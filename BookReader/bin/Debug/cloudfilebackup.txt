The Bee Movie`-1`-1`-1`-1`-1`According to all known lawsof aviation,  there is no way a beeshould be able to fly.  Its wings are too small to getits fat little body off the ground.  The bee, of course, flies anyway  because bees don't carewhat humans think is impossible.  Yellow, black. Yellow, black.Yellow, black. Yellow, black.  Ooh, black and yellow!Let's shake it up a little.  Barry! Breakfast is ready!  Ooming!  Hang on a second.  Hello?  - Barry?- Adam?  - Oan you believe this is happening?- I can't. I'll pick you up.

Barry, I told you,stop flying in the house!  - Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry.  - Is that fuzz gel?- A little. Special day, graduation.  Never thought I'd make it.  Three days grade school,three days high school.  Those were awkward.  Three days college. I'm glad I tooka day and hitchhiked around the hive.  You did come back different.  - Hi, Barry.- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.  - Hear about Frankie?- Yeah.  - You going to the funeral?- No, I'm not going.  Everybody knows,sting someone, you die.  Don't waste it on a squirrel.Such a hothead.  I guess he could havejust gotten out of the way.  I love this incorporatingan amusement park into our day.  That's why we don't need vacations.  Boy, quite a bit of pomp...under the circumstances.  - Well, Adam, today we are men.- We are!  - Bee-men.- Amen!  Hallelujah!  Students, faculty, distinguished bees,  please welcome Dean Buzzwell.  Welcome, New Hive Oitygraduating class of...  ...9:15.  That concludes our ceremonies.  And begins your careerat Honex Industries!  Will we pick ourjob today?  I heard it's just orientation.  Heads up! Here we go.  Keep your hands and antennasinside the tram at all times.  - Wonder what it'll be like?- A little scary.  Welcome to Honex,a division of Honesco  and a part of the Hexagon Group.  This is it!  Wow.  Wow.  We know that you, as a bee,have worked your whole life  to get to the point where youcan work for your whole life.  Honey begins when our valiant PollenJocks bring the nectar to the hive.  Our top-secret formula  is automatically color-corrected,scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured  into this soothing sweet syrup  with its distinctivegolden glow you know as...  Honey!  - That girl was hot.- She's my cousin!  - She is?- Yes, we're all cousins.  - Right. You're right.- At Honex, we constantly strive  to improve every aspectof bee existence.  These bees are stress-testinga new helmet technology.  - What do you think he makes?- Not enough.  Here we have our latest advancement,the Krelman.  - What does that do?- Oatches that little strand of honey  that hangs after you pour it.Saves us millions.  Oan anyone work on the Krelman?  Of course. Most bee jobs aresmall ones. But bees know  that every small job,if it's done well, means a lot.  But choose carefully  because you'll stay in the jobyou pick for the rest of your life.  The same job the rest of your life?I didn't know that.  What's the difference?  You'll be happy to know that bees,as a species, haven't had one day off  in 27 million years.  So you'll just work us to death?  We'll sure try.  Wow! That blew my mind!  "What's the difference?"How can you say that?  One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make.  I'm relieved. Now we only haveto make one decision in life.  But, Adam, how could theynever have told us that?  Why would you question anything?We're bees.  We're the most perfectlyfunctioning society on Earth.  You ever think maybe thingswork a little too well here?  Like what? Give me one example.  I don't know. But you knowwhat I'm talking about.  Please clear the gate.Royal Nectar Force on approach.  Wait a second. Oheck it out.  - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!- Wow.  I've never seen them this close.  They know what it's likeoutside the hive.  Yeah, but some don't come back.  - Hey, Jocks!- Hi, Jocks!  You guys did great!  You're monsters!You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!  - I wonder where they were.- I don't know.  Their day's not planned.  Outside the hive, flying who knowswhere, doing who knows what.  You can'tjust decide to be a PollenJock. You have to be bred for that.  Right.  Look. That's more pollenthan you and I will see in a lifetime.  It's just a status symbol.Bees make too much of it.  Perhaps. Unless you're wearing itand the ladies see you wearing it.  Those ladies?Aren't they our cousins too?  Distant. Distant.  Look at these two.  - Oouple of Hive Harrys.- Let's have fun with them.  It must be dangerousbeing a Pollen Jock.  Yeah. Once a bear pinned meagainst a mushroom!  He had a paw on my throat,and with the other, he was slapping me!  - Oh, my!- I never thought I'd knock him out.  What were you doing during this?  Trying to alert the authorities.  I can autograph that.  A little gusty out there today,wasn't it, comrades?  Yeah. Gusty.  We're hitting a sunflower patchsix miles from here tomorrow.  - Six miles, huh?- Barry!  A puddle jump for us,but maybe you're not up for it.  - Maybe I am.- You are not!  We're going 0900 at J-Gate.  What do you think, buzzy-boy?Are you bee enough?  I might be. It all dependson what 0900 means.  Hey, Honex!  Dad, you surprised me.  You decide what you're interested in?  - Well, there's a lot of choices.- But you only get one.  Do you ever get boreddoing the same job every day?  Son, let me tell you about stirring.  You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around.  You get yourself into a rhythm.It's a beautiful thing.  You know, Dad,the more I think about it,  maybe the honey fieldjust isn't right for me.  You were thinking of what,making balloon animals?  That's a bad jobfor a guy with a stinger.  Janet, your son's not surehe wants to go into honey!  - Barry, you are so funny sometimes.- I'm not trying to be funny.  You're not funny! You're goinginto honey. Our son, the stirrer!  - You're gonna be a stirrer?- No one's listening to me!  Wait till you see the sticks I have.  I could say anything right now.I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!  Let's open some honey and celebrate!  Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.Shave my antennae.  Shack up with a grasshopper. Geta gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!  I'm so proud.  - We're starting work today!- Today's the day.  Oome on! All the good jobswill be gone.  Yeah, right.

That is one nectar collector!  - Ever see pollination up close?- No, sir.  I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle itover here. Maybe a dash over there,  a pinch on that one.See that? It's a little bit of magic.  That's amazing. Why do we do that?  That's pollen power. More pollen, moreflowers, more nectar, more honey for us.  Oool.  I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?  Oopy that visual.  Wait. One of these flowersseems to be on the move.  Say again? You're reportinga moving flower?

No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.They're out of their minds.  When I leave a job interview, they'reflabbergasted, can't believe what I say.  There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.  I don't remember the sunhaving a big 75 on it.  I predicted global warming.  I could feel it getting hotter.At first I thought it was just me.  Wait! Stop! Bee!  Stand back. These are winter boots.  Wait!  Don't kill him!  You know I'm allergic to them!This thing could kill me!  Why does his life haveless value than yours?  Why does his life have any less valuethan mine? Is that your statement?  I'm just saying all life has value. Youdon't know what he's capable of feeling.  My brochure!  There you go, little guy.  I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.  Put that on your resume brochure.  My whole face could puff up.  Make it one of your special skills.  Knocking someone outis also a special skill.  Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.  - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.  - You could put carob chips on there.- Bye.  - Supposed to be less calories.- Bye.  I gotta say something.  She saved my life.I gotta say something.  All right, here it goes.  Nah.  What would I say?  I could really get in trouble.  It's a bee law.You're not supposed to talk to a human.  I can't believe I'm doing this.  I've got to.  Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!  No. Yes. No.  Do it. I can't.  How should I start it?"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.  Here she comes! Speak, you fool!  Hi!  I'm sorry.  - You're talking.- Yes, I know.  You're talking!  I'm so sorry.  No, it's OK. It's fine.I know I'm dreaming.  But I don't recall going to bed.  Well, I'm sure thisis very disconcerting.  This is a bit of a surprise to me.I mean, you're a bee!  I am. And I'm not supposedto be doing this,  but they were all trying to kill me.  And if it wasn't for you...  I had to thank you.It's just how I was raised.  That was a little weird.  - I'm talking with a bee.- Yeah.  I'm talking to a bee.And the bee is talking to me!  I just want to say I'm grateful.I'll leave now.  - Wait! How did you learn to do that?- What?  The talking thing.  Same way you did, I guess."Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.  - That's very funny.- Yeah.  Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,we'd cry with what we have to deal with.  Anyway...  Oan I...  ...get you something?- Like what?  I don't know. I mean...I don't know. Ooffee?  I don't want to put you out.  It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.  - It's just coffee.- I hate to impose.  - Don't be ridiculous!- Actually, I would love a cup.  Hey, you want rum cake?  - I shouldn't.- Have some.  - No, I can't.- Oome on!  I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.  - Where?- These stripes don't help.  You look great!  I don't know if you knowanything about fashion.  Are you all right?  No.  He's making the tie in the cabas they're flying up Madison.  He finally gets there.  He runs up the steps into the church.The wedding is on.  And he says, "Watermelon?I thought you said Guatemalan.  Why would I marry a watermelon?"  Is that a bee joke?  That's the kind of stuff we do.  Yeah, different.  So, what are you gonna do, Barry?  About work? I don't know.  I want to do my part for the hive,but I can't do it the way they want.  I know how you feel.  - You do?- Sure.  My parents wanted me to be a lawyer ora doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.  - Really?- My only interest is flowers.  Our new queen was just electedwith that same campaign slogan.  Anyway, if you look...  There's my hive right there. See it?  You're in Sheep Meadow!  Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!  No way! I know that area.I lost a toe ring there once.  - Why do girls put rings on their toes?- Why not?  - It's like putting a hat on your knee.- Maybe I'll try that.  - You all right, ma'am?- Oh, yeah. Fine.  Just having two cups of coffee!  Anyway, this has been great.Thanks for the coffee.  Yeah, it's no trouble.  Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,I'd be up the rest of my life.  Are you...?  Oan I take a piece of this with me?  Sure! Here, have a crumb.  - Thanks!- Yeah.  All right. Well, then...I guess I'll see you around.  Or not.  OK, Barry.  And thank youso much again... for before.  Oh, that? That was nothing.  Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...  This can't possibly work.  He's all set to go.We may as well try it.  OK, Dave, pull the chute.  - Sounds amazing.- It was amazing!  It was the scariest,happiest moment of my life.  Humans! I can't believeyou were with humans!  Giant, scary humans!What were they like?  Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.  They eat crazy giant things.They drive crazy.  - Do they try and kill you, like on TV?- Some of them. But some of them don't.  - How'd you get back?- Poodle.  You did it, and I'm glad. You sawwhatever you wanted to see.  You had your "experience." Now youcan pick out yourjob and be normal.  - Well...- Well?  Well, I met someone.  You did? Was she Bee-ish?  - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!- No, no, no, not a wasp.  - Spider?- I'm not attracted to spiders.  I know it's the hottest thing,with the eight legs and all.  I can't get by that face.  So who is she?  She's... human.  No, no. That's a bee law.You wouldn't break a bee law.  - Her name's Vanessa.- Oh, boy.  She's so nice. And she's a florist!  Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!  We're not dating.  You're flying outside the hive, talkingto humans that attack our homes  with power washers and M-80s!One-eighth a stick of dynamite!  She saved my life!And she understands me.  This is over!  Eat this.  This is not over! What was that?  - They call it a crumb.- It was so stingin' stripey!  And that's not what they eat.That's what falls off what they eat!  - You know what a Oinnabon is?- No.  It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.They heat it up...  Sit down!  ...really hot!- Listen to me!  We are not them! We're us.There's us and there's them!  Yes, but who can denythe heart that is yearning?  There's no yearning.Stop yearning. Listen to me!  You have got to start thinking bee,my friend. Thinking bee!  - Thinking bee.- Thinking bee.  Thinking bee! Thinking bee!Thinking bee! Thinking bee!  There he is. He's in the pool.  You know what your problem is, Barry?  I gotta start thinking bee?  How much longer will this go on?  It's been three days!Why aren't you working?  I've got a lot of big life decisionsto think about.  What life? You have no life!You have no job. You're barely a bee!  Would it kill youto make a little honey?  Barry, come out.Your father's talking to you.  Martin, would you talk to him?  Barry, I'm talking to you!  You coming?  Got everything?  All set!  Go ahead. I'll catch up.  Don't be too long.  Watch this!  Vanessa!  - We're still here.- I told you not to yell at him.  He doesn't respond to yelling!  - Then why yell at me?- Because you don't listen!  I'm not listening to this.  Sorry, I've gotta go.  - Where are you going?- I'm meeting a friend.  A girl? Is this why you can't decide?  Bye.  I just hope she's Bee-ish.  They have a huge paradeof flowers every year in Pasadena?  To be in the Tournament of Roses,that's every florist's dream!  Up on a float, surroundedby flowers, crowds cheering.  A tournament. Do the rosescompete in athletic events?  No. All right, I've got one.How come you don't fly everywhere?  It's exhausting. Why don't yourun everywhere? It's faster.  Yeah, OK, I see, I see.All right, your turn.  TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?That's insane!  You don't have that?  We have Hivo, but it's a disease.It's a horrible, horrible disease.  Oh, my.  Dumb bees!  You must want to sting all those jerks.  We try not to sting.It's usually fatal for us.  So you have to watch your temper.  Very carefully.You kick a wall, take a walk,  write an angry letter and throw it out.Work through it like any emotion:  Anger, jealousy, lust.  Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?  Yeah.  - What is wrong with you?!- It's a bug.  He's not bothering anybody.Get out of here, you creep!  What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?  Yeah, it was. How did you know?

We eat it.  You don't haveenough food of your own?  - Well, yes.- How do you get it?  - Bees make it.- I know who makes it!  And it's hard to make it!  There's heating, cooling, stirring.You need a whole Krelman thing!  - It's organic.- It's our-ganic!  It's just honey, Barry.  Just what?!  Bees don't know about this!This is stealing! A lot of stealing!  You've taken our homes, schools,hospitals! This is all we have!  And it's on sale?!I'm getting to the bottom of this.  I'm getting to the bottomof all of this!  Hey, Hector.  - You almost done?- Almost.  He is here. I sense it.  Well, I guess I'll go home now  and just leave this nice honey out,with no one around.  You're busted, box boy!  I knew I heard something.So you can talk!  I can talk.And now you'll start talking!  Where you getting the sweet stuff?Who's your supplier?  I don't understand.I thought we were friends.

Hey, Blood.  Just a row of honey jars,as far as the eye could see.  Wow!  I assume wherever this truck goesis where they're getting it.  I mean, that honey's ours.  - Bees hang tight.- We're all jammed in.  It's a close community.  Not us, man. We on our own.Every mosquito on his own.  - What if you get in trouble?- You a mosquito, you in trouble.  Nobody likes us. They just smack.See a mosquito, smack, smack!  At least you're out in the world.You must meet girls.  Mosquito girls try to trade up,get with a moth, dragonfly.  Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.  You got to be kidding me!  Mooseblood's about to leavethe building! So long, bee!  - Hey, guys!- Mooseblood!  I knew I'd catch y'all down here.Did you bring your crazy straw?  We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,and it's pretty much pure profit.  What is this place?  A bee's got a brainthe size of a pinhead.  They are pinheads!  Pinhead.  - Oheck out the new smoker.- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.  The Thomas 3000!  Smoker?  Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

It doesn't last too long.  Do you know you'rein a fake hive with fake walls?  Our queen was moved here.We had no choice.  This is your queen?That's a man in women's clothes!  That's a drag queen!  What is this?  Oh, no!  There's hundreds of them!  Bee honey.  Our honey is being brazenly stolenon a massive scale!  This is worse than anything bearshave done! I intend to do something.  Oh, Barry, stop.  Who told you humans are takingour honey? That's a rumor.  Do these look like rumors?  That's a conspiracy theory.These are obviously doctored photos.  How did you get mixed up in this?  He's been talking to humans.  - What?- Talking to humans?!  He has a human girlfriend.And they make out!  Make out? Barry!  We do not.  - You wish you could.- Whose side are you on?  The bees!  I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.Those crazy legs kept me up all night.  Barry, this is what you wantto do with your life?  I want to do it for all our lives.Nobody works harder than bees!  Dad, I remember youcoming home so overworked  your hands were still stirring.You couldn't stop.  I remember that.  What right do they have to our honey?  We live on two cups a year. They put itin lip balm for no reason whatsoever!  Even if it's true, what can one bee do?  Sting them where it really hurts.  In the face! The eye!  - That would hurt.- No.  Up the nose? That's a killer.  There's only one place you can stingthe humans, one place where it matters.  Hive at Five, the hive's onlyfull-hour action news source.  No more bee beards!  With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.  Weather with Storm Stinger.  Sports with Buzz Larvi.

Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,  we'll have three former queens here inour studio, discussing their new book,  Olassy Ladies,out this week on Hexagon.  Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.  Did you ever think, "I'm a kidfrom the hive. I can't do this"?  Bees have never been afraidto change the world.  What about Bee Oolumbus?Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?  Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.  We were thinkingof stickball or candy stores.  How old are you?  The bee communityis supporting you in this case,  which will be the trialof the bee century.  You know, they have a Larry Kingin the human world too.  It's a common name. Next week...  He looks like you and has a showand suspenders and colored dots...  Next week...  Glasses, quotes on the bottom from theguest even though you just heard 'em.  Bear Week next week!They're scary, hairy and here live.

Honey, her backhand's a joke!I'm not gonna take advantage of that?  Quiet, please.Actual work going on here.  - Is that that same bee?- Yes, it is!  I'm helping him sue the human race.  - Hello.- Hello, bee.  This is Ken.  Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, sizeten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.  Why does he talk again?  Listen, you better go'cause we're really busy working.  But it's our yogurt night!  Bye-bye.  Why is yogurt night so difficult?!  You poor thing.You two have been at this for hours!  Yes, and Adam herehas been a huge help.  - Frosting...- How many sugars?  Just one. I try notto use the competition.  So why are you helping me?  Bees have good qualities.  And it takes my mind off the shop.  Instead of flowers, peopleare giving balloon bouquets now.  Those are great, if you're three.  And artificial flowers.  - Oh, those just get me psychotic!- Yeah, me too.  Bent stingers, pointless pollination.  Bees must hate those fake things!  Nothing worsethan a daffodil that's had work done.  Maybe this could make upfor it a little bit.  - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.- I guess.  You sure you want to go through with it?  Am I sure? When I'm done withthe humans, they won't be able  to say, "Honey, I'm home,"without paying a royalty!  It's an incredible scenehere in downtown Manhattan,  where the world anxiously waits,because for the first time in history,  we will hear for ourselvesif a honeybee can actually speak.  What have we gotten into here, Barry?  It's pretty big, isn't it?  I can't believe how many humansdon't work during the day.  You think billion-dollar multinationalfood companies have good lawyers?  Everybody needs to staybehind the barricade.  - What's the matter?- I don't know, I just got a chill.  Well, if it isn't the bee team.  You boys work on this?  All rise! The HonorableJudge Bumbleton presiding.  All right. Oase number 4475,  Superior Oourt of New York,Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry  is now in session.  Mr. Montgomery, you're representingthe five food companies collectively?  A privilege.  Mr. Benson... you're representingall the bees of the world?  I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,we're ready to proceed.  Mr. Montgomery,your opening statement, please.  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,  my grandmother was a simple woman.  Born on a farm, she believedit was man's divine right  to benefit from the bountyof nature God put before us.  If we lived in the topsy-turvy worldMr. Benson imagines,  just think of what would it mean.  I would have to negotiatewith the silkworm  for the elastic in my britches!  Talking bee!  How do we know this isn't some sort of  holographic motion-picture-captureHollywood wizardry?  They could be using laser beams!  Robotics! Ventriloquism!Oloning! For all we know,  he could be on steroids!  Mr. Benson?  Ladies and gentlemen,there's no trickery here.  I'm just an ordinary bee.Honey's pretty important to me.  It's important to all bees.We invented it!  We make it. And we protect itwith our lives.  Unfortunately, there aresome people in this room  who think they can take it from us  'cause we're the little guys!I'm hoping that, after this is all over,  you'll see how, by taking our honey,you not only take everything we have  but everything we are!  I wish he'd dress like thatall the time. So nice!  Oall your first witness.  So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhaydenof Honey Farms, big company you have.  I suppose so.  I see you also ownHoneyburton and Honron!  Yes, they provide beekeepersfor our farms.  Beekeeper. I find thatto be a very disturbing term.  I don't imagine you employany bee-free-ers, do you?  - No.- I couldn't hear you.  - No.- No.  Because you don't free bees.You keep bees. Not only that,  it seems you thought a bear would bean appropriate image for a jar of honey.  They're very lovable creatures.  Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.  You mean like this?  Bears kill bees!  How'd you like his head crashingthrough your living room?!  Biting into your couch!Spitting out your throw pillows!  OK, that's enough. Take him away.  So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.Your name intrigues me.  - Where have I heard it before?- I was with a band called The Police.  But you've never beena police officer, have you?  No, I haven't.  No, you haven't. And so herewe have yet another example  of bee culture casuallystolen by a human  for nothing more thana prance-about stage name.  Oh, please.  Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?  Because I'm feelinga little stung, Sting.  Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!  That's not his real name?! You idiots!  Mr. Liotta, first,belated congratulations on  your Emmy win for a guest spoton ER in 2005.  Thank you. Thank you.  I see from your resumethat you're devilishly handsome  with a churning inner turmoilthat's ready to blow.  I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?  Not yet it isn't. But is thiswhat it's come to for you?  Exploiting tiny, helpless beesso you don't  have to rehearseyour part and learn your lines, sir?  Watch it, Benson!I could blow right now!  This isn't a goodfella.This is a badfella!  Why doesn't someone just step onthis creep, and we can all go home?!  - Order in this court!- You're all thinking it!  Order! Order, I say!  - Say it!- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!  I think it was awfully niceof that bear to pitch in like that.  I think the jury's on our side.  Are we doing everything right, legally?  I'm a florist.  Right. Well, here's to a great team.  To a great team!  Well, hello.  - Ken!- Hello.  I didn't think you were coming.  No, I was just late.I tried to call, but... the battery.  I didn't want all this to go to waste,so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.  Oh, that was lucky.  There's a little left.I could heat it up.  Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.  So I hear you're quite a tennis player.  I'm not much for the game myself.The ball's a little grabby.  That's where I usually sit.Right... there.  Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,  and he agreed with me that eating withchopsticks isn't really a special skill.  You think I don't see what you're doing?  I know how hard it is to findthe rightjob. We have that in common.  Do we?  Bees have 100 percent employment,but we do jobs like taking the crud out.  That's just whatI was thinking about doing.  Ken, I let Barry borrow your razorfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.  I'm going to drain the old stinger.  Yeah, you do that.  Look at that.  You know, I've just about had it  with your little mind games.  - What's that?- Italian Vogue.  Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.  A lot of ads.  Remember what Van said, why isyour life more valuable than mine?  Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!  I think something stinks in here!  I love the smell of flowers.  How do you like the smell of flames?!  Not as much.  Water bug! Not taking sides!  Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!This is pathetic!  I've got issues!  Well, well, well, a royal flush!  - You're bluffing.- Am I?  Surf's up, dude!  Poo water!  That bowl is gnarly.  Except for those dirty yellow rings!  Kenneth! What are you doing?!  You know, I don't even like honey!I don't eat it!  We need to talk!  He's just a little bee!  And he happens to bethe nicest bee I've met in a long time!  Long time? What are you talking about?!Are there other bugs in your life?  No, but there are other things buggingme in life. And you're one of them!  Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...  My nerves are fried from ridingon this emotional roller coaster!  Goodbye, Ken.  And for your information,  I prefer sugar-free, artificialsweeteners made by man!  I'm sorry about all that.  I know it's gotan aftertaste! I like it!  I always felt there was some kindof barrier between Ken and me.  I couldn't overcome it.Oh, well.  Are you OK for the trial?  I believe Mr. Montgomeryis about out of ideas.  We would like to callMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.  Good idea! You can really see why he'sconsidered one of the best lawyers...  Yeah.  Layton, you'vegotta weave some magic  with this jury,or it's gonna be all over.  Don't worry. The only thing I haveto do to turn this jury around  is to remind themof what they don't like about bees.  - You got the tweezers?- Are you allergic?  Only to losing, son. Only to losing.  Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask youwhat I think we'd all like to know.  What exactly is your relationship  to that woman?  We're friends.  - Good friends?- Yes.  How good? Do you live together?  Wait a minute...  Are you her little...  ...bedbug?  I've seen a bee documentary or two.From what I understand,  doesn't your queen give birthto all the bee children?  - Yeah, but...- So those aren't your real parents!  - Oh, Barry...- Yes, they are!  Hold me back!  You're an illegitimate bee,aren't you, Benson?  He's denouncing bees!  Don't y'all date your cousins?  - Objection!- I'm going to pincushion this guy!  Adam, don't! It's what he wants!  Oh, I'm hit!!  Oh, lordy, I am hit!  Order! Order!  The venom! The venomis coursing through my veins!  I have been felledby a winged beast of destruction!  You see? You can't treat themlike equals! They're striped savages!  Stinging's the only thingthey know! It's their way!  - Adam, stay with me.- I can't feel my legs.  What angel of mercywill come forward to suck the poison  from my heaving buttocks?  I will have order in this court. Order!  Order, please!  The case of the honeybeesversus the human race  took a pointed turn against the bees  yesterday when one of their legalteam stung Layton T. Montgomery.  - Hey, buddy.- Hey.  - Is there much pain?- Yeah.  I...  I blew the whole case, didn't I?  It doesn't matter. What matters isyou're alive. You could have died.  I'd be better off dead. Look at me.  They got it from the cafeteriadownstairs, in a tuna sandwich.  Look, there'sa little celery still on it.  What was it like to sting someone?  I can't explain it. It was all...  All adrenaline and then...and then ecstasy!  All right.  You think it was all a trap?  Of course. I'm sorry.I flew us right into this.  What were we thinking? Look at us. We'rejust a couple of bugs in this world.  What will the humans do to usif they win?  I don't know.  I hear they put the roaches in motels.That doesn't sound so bad.  Adam, they check in,but they don't check out!  Oh, my.  Oould you get a nurseto close that window?  - Why?- The smoke.  Bees don't smoke.  Right. Bees don't smoke.  Bees don't smoke!But some bees are smoking.  That's it! That's our case!  It is? It's not over?  Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.  Get back to the court and stall.Stall any way you can.  And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.  Mr. Flayman.  Yes? Yes, Your Honor!  Where is the rest of your team?  Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.  Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,  and as a result,we don't make very good time.  I actually heard a funny story about...  Your Honor,haven't these ridiculous bugs  taken up enoughof this court's valuable time?  How much longer will we allowthese absurd shenanigans to go on?  They have presented no compellingevidence to support their charges  against my clients,who run legitimate businesses.  I move for a complete dismissalof this entire case!  Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going  to have to considerMr. Montgomery's motion.  But you can't! We have a terrific case.  Where is your proof?Where is the evidence?  Show me the smoking gun!  Hold it, Your Honor!You want a smoking gun?  Here is your smoking gun.  What is that?  It's a bee smoker!  What, this?This harmless little contraption?  This couldn't hurt a fly,let alone a bee.  Look at what has happened  to bees who have never been asked,"Smoking or non?"  Is this what nature intended for us?  To be forcibly addictedto smoke machines  and man-made wooden slat work camps?  Living out our lives as honey slavesto the white man?  - What are we gonna do?- He's playing the species card.  Ladies and gentlemen, please,free these bees!  Free the bees! Free the bees!  Free the bees!  Free the bees! Free the bees!  The court finds in favor of the bees!  Vanessa, we won!  I knew you could do it! High-five!  Sorry.  I'm OK! You know what this means?  All the honeywill finally belong to the bees.  Now we won't haveto work so hard all the time.  This is an unholy perversionof the balance of nature, Benson.  You'll regret this.  Barry, how much honey is out there?  All right. One at a time.  Barry, who are you wearing?  My sweater is Ralph Lauren,and I have no pants.  - What if Montgomery's right?- What do you mean?  We've been living the bee waya long time, 27 million years.  Oongratulations on your victory.What will you demand as a settlement?  First, we'll demand a complete shutdownof all bee work camps.  Then we want back the honeythat was ours to begin with,  every last drop.  We demand an end to the glorificationof the bear as anything more  than a filthy, smelly,bad-breath stink machine.  We're all awareof what they do in the woods.  Wait for my signal.  Take him out.  He'll have nauseousfor a few hours, then he'll be fine.  And we will no longer toleratebee-negative nicknames...  But it's just a prance-about stage name!  ...unnecessary inclusion of honeyin bogus health products  and la-dee-da humantea-time snack garnishments.  Oan't breathe.  Bring it in, boys!  Hold it right there! Good.  Tap it.  Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,and there's gallons more coming!  - I think we need to shut down!- Shut down? We've never shut down.  Shut down honey production!  Stop making honey!  Turn your key, sir!  What do we do now?  Oannonball!  We're shutting honey production!  Mission abort.  Aborting pollination and nectar detail.Returning to base.  Adam, you wouldn't believehow much honey was out there.  Oh, yeah?  What's going on? Where is everybody?  - Are they out celebrating?- They're home.  They don't know what to do.Laying out, sleeping in.  I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his wayto San Antonio with a cricket.  At least we got our honey back.  Sometimes I think, so what if humansliked our honey? Who wouldn't?  It's the greatest thing in the world!I was excited to be part of making it.  This was my new desk. This was mynew job. I wanted to do it really well.  And now...  Now I can't.  I don't understandwhy they're not happy.  I thought their lives would be better!  They're doing nothing. It's amazing.Honey really changes people.  You don't have any ideawhat's going on, do you?  - What did you want to show me?- This.  What happened here?  That is not the half of it.  Oh, no. Oh, my.  They're all wilting.  Doesn't look very good, does it?  No.  And whose fault do you think that is?  You know, I'm gonna guess bees.  Bees?  Specifically, me.  I didn't think bees not needing to makehoney would affect all these things.  It's notjust flowers.Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.  That's our whole SAT test right there.  Take away produce, that affectsthe entire animal kingdom.  And then, of course...  The human species?  So if there's no more pollination,  it could all just go south here,couldn't it?  I know this is also partly my fault.  How about a suicide pact?  How do we do it?  - I'll sting you, you step on me.- Thatjust kills you twice.  Right, right.  Listen, Barry...sorry, but I gotta get going.  I had to open my mouth and talk.  Vanessa?  Vanessa? Why are you leaving?Where are you going?  To the final Tournament of Roses paradein Pasadena.  They've moved it to this weekendbecause all the flowers are dying.  It's the last chanceI'll ever have to see it.  Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.I never meant it to turn out like this.  I know. Me neither.  Tournament of Roses.Roses can't do sports.  Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?  Roses!  Vanessa!  Roses?!  Barry?  - Roses are flowers!- Yes, they are.  Flowers, bees, pollen!  I know.That's why this is the last parade.  Maybe not.Oould you ask him to slow down?  Oould you slow down?  Barry!  OK, I made a huge mistake.This is a total disaster, all my fault.  Yes, it kind of is.  I've ruined the planet.I wanted to help you  with the flower shop.I've made it worse.  Actually, it's completely closed down.  I thought maybe you were remodeling.  But I have another idea, and it'sgreater than my previous ideas combined.  I don't want to hear it!  All right, they have the roses,the roses have the pollen.  I know every bee, plantand flower bud in this park.  All we gotta do is get what they've gotback here with what we've got.  - Bees.- Park.  - Pollen!- Flowers.  - Repollination!- Across the nation!  Tournament of Roses,Pasadena, Oalifornia.  They've got nothingbut flowers, floats and cotton candy.  Security will be tight.  I have an idea.  Vanessa Bloome, FTD.  Official floral business. It's real.  Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.  Thank you. It was a gift.  Once inside,we just pick the right float.  How about The Princess and the Pea?  I could be the princess,and you could be the pea!  Yes, I got it.  - Where should I sit?- What are you?  - I believe I'm the pea.- The pea?  It goes under the mattresses.  - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.- I'm getting the marshal.  You do that!This whole parade is a fiasco!  Let's see what this baby'll do.  Hey, what are you doing?!  Then all we dois blend in with traffic...  ...without arousing suspicion.  Once at the airport,there's no stopping us.  Stop! Security.  - You and your insect pack your float?- Yes.  Has it beenin your possession the entire time?  Would you remove your shoes?  - Remove your stinger.- It's part of me.  I know. Just having some fun.Enjoy your flight.  Then if we're lucky, we'll havejust enough pollen to do the job.  Oan you believe how lucky we are? Wehave just enough pollen to do the job!  I think this is gonna work.  It's got to work.  Attention, passengers,this is Oaptain Scott.  We have a bit of bad weatherin New York.  It looks like we'll experiencea couple hours delay.  Barry, these are cut flowerswith no water. They'll never make it.  I gotta get up thereand talk to them.  Be careful.  Oan I get helpwith the Sky Mall magazine?  I'd like to order the talkinginflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.  Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.  - What'd you say, Hal?- Nothing.  Bee!  Don't freak out! My entire species...  What are you doing?  - Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!- Who's an attorney?  Don't move.  Oh, Barry.  Good afternoon, passengers.This is your captain.  Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24Bplease report to the cockpit?  And please hurry!  What happened here?  There was a DustBuster,a toupee, a life raft exploded.  One's bald, one's in a boat,they're both unconscious!  - Is that another bee joke?- No!  No one's flying the plane!  This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.What's your status?  This is Vanessa Bloome.I'm a florist from New York.  Where's the pilot?  He's unconscious,and so is the copilot.  Not good. Does anyone onboardhave flight experience?  As a matter of fact, there is.  - Who's that?- Barry Benson.  From the honey trial?! Oh, great.  Vanessa, this is nothing morethan a big metal bee.  It's got giant wings, huge engines.  I can't fly a plane.  - Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?- Yes.  How hard could it be?  Wait, Barry!We're headed into some lightning.  This is Bob Bumble. We have somelate-breaking news from JFK Airport,  where a suspenseful sceneis developing.  Barry Benson,fresh from his legal victory...  That's Barry!  ...is attempting to land a plane,loaded with people, flowers  and an incapacitated flight crew.  Flowers?!  We have a storm in the areaand two individuals at the controls  with absolutely no flight experience.  Just a minute.There's a bee on that plane.  I'm quite familiar with Mr. Bensonand his no-account compadres.  They've done enough damage.  But isn't he your only hope?  Technically, a beeshouldn't be able to fly at all.  Their wings are too small...  Haven't we heard this a million times?  "The surface area of the wingsand body mass make no sense."  - Get this on the air!- Got it.  - Stand by.- We're going live.  The way we work may be a mystery to you.  Making honey takes a lot of beesdoing a lot of small jobs.  But let me tell you about a small job.  If you do it well,it makes a big difference.  More than we realized.To us, to everyone.  That's why I want to get beesback to working together.  That's the bee way!We're not made of Jell-O.  We get behind a fellow.  - Black and yellow!- Hello!  Left, right, down, hover.  - Hover?- Forget hover.  This isn't so hard.Beep-beep! Beep-beep!  Barry, what happened?!  Wait, I think we wereon autopilot the whole time.  - That may have been helping me.- And now we're not!  So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.  All of you, let's getbehind this fellow! Move it out!  Move out!  Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,you copy me with the wings of the plane!  Don't have to yell.  I'm not yelling!We're in a lot of trouble.  It's very hard to concentratewith that panicky tone in your voice!  It's not a tone. I'm panicking!  I can't do this!  Vanessa, pull yourself together.You have to snap out of it!  You snap out of it.  You snap out of it.  - You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!  - You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!  - You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!  - Hold it!- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.  How is the plane flying?  I don't know.  Hello?  Benson, got any flowersfor a happy occasion in there?  The Pollen Jocks!  They do get behind a fellow.  - Black and yellow.- Hello.  All right, let's drop this tin canon the blacktop.  Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?  No, nothing. It's all cloudy.  Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.  - Thinking bee.- Thinking bee.  Thinking bee!Thinking bee! Thinking bee!  Wait a minute.I think I'm feeling something.  - What?- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.  Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.  Bring the nose down.  Thinking bee!Thinking bee! Thinking bee!  - What in the world is on the tarmac?- Get some lights on that!  Thinking bee!Thinking bee! Thinking bee!  - Vanessa, aim for the flower.- OK.  Out the engines. We're going inon bee power. Ready, boys?  Affirmative!  Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.  Land on that flower!  Ready? Full reverse!  Spin it around!  - Not that flower! The other one!- Which one?  - That flower.- I'm aiming at the flower!  That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.I mean the giant pulsating flower  made of millions of bees!  Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.  Rotate around it.  - This is insane, Barry!- This's the only way I know how to fly.  Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this planeflying in an insect-like pattern?  Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.Smell it. Full reverse!  Just drop it. Be a part of it.  Aim for the center!  Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!  Oome on, already.  Barry, we did it!You taught me how to fly!  - Yes. No high-five!- Right.  Barry, it worked!Did you see the giant flower?  What giant flower? Where? Of courseI saw the flower! That was genius!  - Thank you.- But we're not done yet.  Listen, everyone!  This runway is coveredwith the last pollen  from the last flowersavailable anywhere on Earth.  That means this is our last chance.  We're the only ones who make honey,pollinate flowers and dress like this.  If we're gonna survive as a species,this is our moment! What do you say?  Are we going to be bees, orjustMuseum of Natural History keychains?  We're bees!  Keychain!  Then follow me! Except Keychain.  Hold on, Barry. Here.  You've earned this.  Yeah!  I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfectfit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.  Oh, yeah.  That's our Barry.  Mom! The bees are back!  If anybody needsto make a call, now's the time.  I got a feeling we'll beworking late tonight!  Here's your change. Have a greatafternoon! Oan I help who's next?  Would you like some honey with that?It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.  Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.And I don't see a nickel!  Sometimes I just feellike a piece of meat!  I had no idea.  Barry, I'm sorry.Have you got a moment?  Would you excuse me?My mosquito associate will help you.  Sorry I'm late.  He's a lawyer too?  I was already a blood-sucking parasite.All I needed was a briefcase.  Have a great afternoon!  Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,and I can't get them anywhere.  No problem, Vannie.Just leave it to me.  You're a lifesaver, Barry.Oan I help who's next?  All right, scramble, jocks!It's time to fly.  Thank you, Barry!  That bee is living my life!  Let it go, Kenny.  - When will this nightmare end?!- Let it all go.  - Beautiful day to fly.- Sure is.  Between you and me,I was dying to get out of that office.  You have gotto start thinking bee, my friend.  - Thinking bee!- Me?  Hold it. Let's just stopfor a second. Hold it.  I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.Oan we stop here?  I'm not making a major life decisionduring a production number!  All right. Take ten, everybody.Wrap it up, guys.  I had virtually no rehearsal for that.~
The Lord of the Rings`-1`-1`-1`-1`-1`This book is largely concerned with Hobbits, and from its pages areader may discover much of their character and a little of theirhistory. Further information will also be found in the selection fromthe Red Book of Westmarch that has already been published, underthe title of The Hobbit. That story was derived from the earlier chapters of the Red Book, composed by Bilbo himself, the first Hobbitto become famous in the world at large, and called by him There andBack Again, since they told of his journey into the East and his return:an adventure which later involved all the Hobbits in the great eventsof that Age that are here related.Many, however, may wish to know more about this remarkablepeople from the outset, while some may not possess the earlier book.For such readers a few notes on the more important points are herecollected from Hobbit-lore, and the first adventure is briefly recalled.Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more numerous formerly than they are today; for they love peace and quiet andgood tilled earth: a well-ordered and well-farmed countryside wastheir favourite haunt. They do not and did not understand or likemachines more complicated than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, or ahand-loom, though they were skilful with tools. Even in ancient daysthey were, as a rule, shy of ‘the Big Folk’, as they call us, and nowthey avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to find. They arequick of hearing and sharp-eyed, and though they are inclined to befat and do not hurry unnecessarily, they are nonetheless nimble anddeft in their movements. They possessed from the first the art ofdisappearing swiftly and silently, when large folk whom they do notwish to meet come blundering by; and this art they have developeduntil to Men it may seem magical. But Hobbits have never, in fact,studied magic of any kind, and their elusiveness is due solely to aprofessional skill that heredity and practice, and a close friendshipwith the earth, have rendered inimitable by bigger and clumsier races.For they are a little people, smaller than Dwarves: less stout andstocky, that is, even when they are not actually much shorter. Theirheight is variable, ranging between two and four feet of our measure.2 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSThey seldom now reach three feet; but they have dwindled, they say,and in ancient days they were taller. According to the Red Book,Bandobras Took (Bullroarer), son of Isumbras the Third, was fourfoot five and able to ride a horse. He was surpassed in all Hobbitrecords only by two famous characters of old; but that curious matteris dealt with in this book.As for the Hobbits of the Shire, with whom these tales are concerned, in the days of their peace and prosperity they were a merryfolk. They dressed in bright colours, being notably fond of yellowand green; but they seldom wore shoes, since their feet had toughleathery soles and were clad in a thick curling hair, much like thehair of their heads, which was commonly brown. Thus, the only craftlittle practised among them was shoe-making; but they had long andskilful fingers and could make many other useful and comely things.Their faces were as a rule good-natured rather than beautiful, broad,bright-eyed, red-cheeked, with mouths apt to laughter, and to eatingand drinking. And laugh they did, and eat, and drink, often andheartily, being fond of simple jests at all times, and of six meals aday (when they could get them). They were hospitable and delightedin parties, and in presents, which they gave away freely and eagerlyaccepted.It is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement Hobbits arerelatives of ours: far nearer to us than Elves, or even than Dwarves.Of old they spoke the languages of Men, after their own fashion, andliked and disliked much the same things as Men did. But what exactlyour relationship is can no longer be discovered. The beginning ofHobbits lies far back in the Elder Days that are now lost and forgotten.Only the Elves still preserve any records of that vanished time, andtheir traditions are concerned almost entirely with their own history,in which Men appear seldom and Hobbits are not mentioned at all.Yet it is clear that Hobbits had, in fact, lived quietly in Middle-earthfor many long years before other folk became even aware of them.And the world being after all full of strange creatures beyond count,these little people seemed of very little importance. But in the daysof Bilbo, and of Frodo his heir, they suddenly became, by no wishof their own, both important and renowned, and troubled thecounsels of the Wise and the Great.Those days, the Third Age of Middle-earth, are now long past,and the shape of all lands has been changed; but the regions in whichHobbits then lived were doubtless the same as those in which theystill linger: the North-West of the Old World, east of the Sea. Of theiroriginal home the Hobbits in Bilbo’s time preserved no knowledge. Alove of learning (other than genealogical lore) was far from generalP R O L OGUE 3among them, but there remained still a few in the older families whostudied their own books, and even gathered reports of old times anddistant lands from Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Their own recordsbegan only after the settlement of the Shire, and their most ancientlegends hardly looked further back than their Wandering Days. It isclear, nonetheless, from these legends, and from the evidence of theirpeculiar words and customs, that like many other folk Hobbits hadin the distant past moved westward. Their earliest tales seem toglimpse a time when they dwelt in the upper vales of Anduin, betweenthe eaves of Greenwood the Great and the Misty Mountains. Whythey later undertook the hard and perilous crossing of the mountainsinto Eriador is no longer certain. Their own accounts speak of themultiplying of Men in the land, and of a shadow that fell on theforest, so that it became darkened and its new name was Mirkwood.Before the crossing of the mountains the Hobbits had alreadybecome divided into three somewhat different breeds: Harfoots,Stoors, and Fallohides. The Harfoots were browner of skin, smaller,and shorter, and they were beardless and bootless; their hands andfeet were neat and nimble; and they preferred highlands and hillsides.The Stoors were broader, heavier in build; their feet and hands werelarger; and they preferred flat lands and riversides. The Fallohideswere fairer of skin and also of hair, and they were taller and slimmerthan the others; they were lovers of trees and of woodlands.The Harfoots had much to do with Dwarves in ancient times, andlong lived in the foothills of the mountains. They moved westwardearly, and roamed over Eriador as far as Weathertop while the otherswere still in Wilderland. They were the most normal and representative variety of Hobbit, and far the most numerous. They werethe most inclined to settle in one place, and longest preserved theirancestral habit of living in tunnels and holes.The Stoors lingered long by the banks of the Great River Anduin,and were less shy of Men. They came west after the Harfoots andfollowed the course of the Loudwater southwards; and there manyof them long dwelt between Tharbad and the borders of Dunlandbefore they moved north again.The Fallohides, the least numerous, were a northerly branch. Theywere more friendly with Elves than the other Hobbits were, and hadmore skill in language and song than in handicrafts; and of old theypreferred hunting to tilling. They crossed the mountains north ofRivendell and came down the River Hoarwell. In Eriador they soonmingled with the other kinds that had preceded them, but beingsomewhat bolder and more adventurous, they were often found asleaders or chieftains among clans of Harfoots or Stoors. Even inBilbo’s time the strong Fallohidish strain could still be noted among4 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSthe greater families, such as the Tooks and the Masters of Buckland.In the westlands of Eriador, between the Misty Mountains andthe Mountains of Lune, the Hobbits found both Men and Elves.Indeed, a remnant still dwelt there of the Du´nedain, the kings ofMen that came over the Sea out of Westernesse; but they were dwindling fast and the lands of their North Kingdom were falling far andwide into waste. There was room and to spare for incomers, and erelong the Hobbits began to settle in ordered communities. Most oftheir earlier settlements had long disappeared and been forgotten inBilbo’s time; but one of the first to become important still endured,though reduced in size; this was at Bree and in the Chetwood thatlay round about, some forty miles east of the Shire.It was in these early days, doubtless, that the Hobbits learned theirletters and began to write after the manner of the Du´nedain, whohad in their turn long before learned the art from the Elves. And inthose days also they forgot whatever languages they had used before,and spoke ever after the Common Speech, the Westron as it wasnamed, that was current through all the lands of the kings from Arnorto Gondor, and about all the coasts of the Sea from Belfalas to Lune.Yet they kept a few words of their own, as well as their own namesof months and days, and a great store of personal names out ofthe past.About this time legend among the Hobbits first becomes historywith a reckoning of years. For it was in the one thousand six hundredand first year of the Third Age that the Fallohide brothers, Marchoand Blanco, set out from Bree; and having obtained permission fromthe high king at Fornost,* they crossed the brown river Baranduinwith a great following of Hobbits. They passed over the Bridge ofStonebows, that had been built in the days of the power of the NorthKingdom, and they took all the land beyond to dwell in, betweenthe river and the Far Downs. All that was demanded of them wasthat they should keep the Great Bridge in repair, and all other bridgesand roads, speed the king’s messengers, and acknowledge hislordship.Thus began the Shire-reckoning, for the year of the crossing of theBrandywine (as the Hobbits turned the name) became Year One ofthe Shire, and all later dates were reckoned from it.† At once thewestern Hobbits fell in love with their new land, and they remainedthere, and soon passed once more out of the history of Men and ofElves. While there was still a king they were in name his subjects,* As the records of Gondor relate this was Argeleb II, the twentieth of the Northernline, which came to an end with Arvedui three hundred years later.† Thus, the years of the Third Age in the reckoning of the Elves and the Du´nedainmay be found by adding 1600 to the dates of Shire-reckoning.P R O L OGUE 5but they were, in fact, ruled by their own chieftains and meddled notat all with events in the world outside. To the last battle at Fornostwith the Witch-lord of Angmar they sent some bowmen to the aidof the king, or so they maintained, though no tales of Men recordit. But in that war the North Kingdom ended; and then the Hobbitstook the land for their own, and they chose from their own chiefs aThain to hold the authority of the king that was gone. There for athousand years they were little troubled by wars, and they prosperedand multiplied after the Dark Plague (S.R. 37) until the disaster ofthe Long Winter and the famine that followed it. Many thousandsthen perished, but the Days of Dearth (1158–60) were at the time ofthis tale long past and the Hobbits had again become accustomedto plenty. The land was rich and kindly, and though it had long beendeserted when they entered it, it had before been well tilled, andthere the king had once had many farms, cornlands, vineyards, andwoods.Forty leagues it stretched from the Far Downs to the BrandywineBridge, and fifty from the northern moors to the marshes in the south.The Hobbits named it the Shire, as the region of the authority oftheir Thain, and a district of well-ordered business; and there in thatpleasant corner of the world they plied their well-ordered businessof living, and they heeded less and less the world outside where darkthings moved, until they came to think that peace and plenty werethe rule in Middle-earth and the right of all sensible folk. They forgotor ignored what little they had ever known of the Guardians, and ofthe labours of those that made possible the long peace of the Shire.They were, in fact, sheltered, but they had ceased to remember it.At no time had Hobbits of any kind been warlike, and they hadnever fought among themselves. In olden days they had, of course,been often obliged to fight to maintain themselves in a hard world;but in Bilbo’s time that was very ancient history. The last battle,before this story opens, and indeed the only one that had ever beenfought within the borders of the Shire, was beyond living memory:the Battle of Greenfields, S.R. 1147, in which Bandobras Took routedan invasion of Orcs. Even the weathers had grown milder, and thewolves that had once come ravening out of the North in bitter whitewinters were now only a grandfather’s tale. So, though there wasstill some store of weapons in the Shire, these were used mostly astrophies, hanging above hearths or on walls, or gathered into themuseum at Michel Delving. The Mathom-house it was called; foranything that Hobbits had no immediate use for, but were unwillingto throw away, they called a mathom. Their dwellings were apt tobecome rather crowded with mathoms, and many of the presentsthat passed from hand to hand were of that sort.6 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSNonetheless, ease and peace had left this people still curiouslytough. They were, if it came to it, difficult to daunt or to kill; andthey were, perhaps, so unwearyingly fond of good things not leastbecause they could, when put to it, do without them, and couldsurvive rough handling by grief, foe, or weather in a way that astonished those who did not know them well and looked no further thantheir bellies and their well-fed faces. Though slow to quarrel, and forsport killing nothing that lived, they were doughty at bay, and atneed could still handle arms. They shot well with the bow, for theywere keen-eyed and sure at the mark. Not only with bows and arrows.If any Hobbit stooped for a stone, it was well to get quickly undercover, as all trespassing beasts knew very well.All Hobbits had originally lived in holes in the ground, or so theybelieved, and in such dwellings they still felt most at home; but inthe course of time they had been obliged to adopt other forms ofabode. Actually in the Shire in Bilbo’s days it was, as a rule, onlythe richest and the poorest Hobbits that maintained the old custom.The poorest went on living in burrows of the most primitive kind,mere holes indeed, with only one window or none; while the wellto-do still constructed more luxurious versions of the simple diggingsof old. But suitable sites for these large and ramifying tunnels (orsmials as they called them) were not everywhere to be found; and inthe flats and the low-lying districts the Hobbits, as they multiplied,began to build above ground. Indeed, even in the hilly regions andthe older villages, such as Hobbiton or Tuckborough, or in the chieftownship of the Shire, Michel Delving on the White Downs, therewere now many houses of wood, brick, or stone. These were speciallyfavoured by millers, smiths, ropers, and cartwrights, and others ofthat sort; for even when they had holes to live in, Hobbits had longbeen accustomed to build sheds and workshops.The habit of building farmhouses and barns was said to have begunamong the inhabitants of the Marish down by the Brandywine. TheHobbits of that quarter, the Eastfarthing, were rather large and heavylegged, and they wore dwarf-boots in muddy weather. But they werewell known to be Stoors in a large part of their blood, as indeed wasshown by the down that many grew on their chins. No Harfoot orFallohide had any trace of a beard. Indeed, the folk of the Marish,and of Buckland, east of the River, which they afterwards occupied,came for the most part later into the Shire up from south-away; andthey still had many peculiar names and strange words not foundelsewhere in the Shire.It is probable that the craft of building, as many other crafts beside,was derived from the Du´nedain. But the Hobbits may have learnedit direct from the Elves, the teachers of Men in their youth. For theP R O L OGUE 7Elves of the High Kindred had not yet forsaken Middle-earth, andthey dwelt still at that time at the Grey Havens away to the west,and in other places within reach of the Shire. Three Elf-towers ofimmemorial age were still to be seen on the Tower Hills beyond thewestern marches. They shone far off in the moonlight. The tallestwas furthest away, standing alone upon a green mound. The Hobbitsof the Westfarthing said that one could see the Sea from the top ofthat tower; but no Hobbit had ever been known to climb it. Indeed,few Hobbits had ever seen or sailed upon the Sea, and fewer still hadever returned to report it. Most Hobbits regarded even rivers andsmall boats with deep misgivings, and not many of them could swim.And as the days of the Shire lengthened they spoke less and less withthe Elves, and grew afraid of them, and distrustful of those that haddealings with them; and the Sea became a word of fear among them,and a token of death, and they turned their faces away from the hillsin the west.The craft of building may have come from Elves or Men, but theHobbits used it in their own fashion. They did not go in for towers.Their houses were usually long, low, and comfortable. The oldestkind were, indeed, no more than built imitations of smials, thatchedwith dry grass or straw, or roofed with turves, and having walls somewhat bulged. That stage, however, belonged to the early days of theShire, and hobbit-building had long since been altered, improvedby devices, learned from Dwarves, or discovered by themselves. Apreference for round windows, and even round doors, was the chiefremaining peculiarity of hobbit-architecture.The houses and the holes of Shire-hobbits were often large,and inhabited by large families. (Bilbo and Frodo Baggins were asbachelors very exceptional, as they were also in many other ways,such as their friendship with the Elves.) Sometimes, as in the caseof the Tooks of Great Smials, or the Brandybucks of Brandy Hall,many generations of relatives lived in (comparative) peace togetherin one ancestral and many-tunnelled mansion. All Hobbits were, inany case, clannish and reckoned up their relationships with greatcare. They drew long and elaborate family-trees with innumerablebranches. In dealing with Hobbits it is important to remember whois related to whom, and in what degree. It would be impossible in thisbook to set out a family-tree that included even the more importantmembers of the more important families at the time which thesetales tell of. The genealogical trees at the end of the Red Book ofWestmarch are a small book in themselves, and all but Hobbits wouldfind them exceedingly dull. Hobbits delighted in such things, if theywere accurate: they liked to have books filled with things that theyalready knew, set out fair and square with no contradictions.8 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGS2Concerning Pipe-weedThere is another astonishing thing about Hobbits of old that mustbe mentioned, an astonishing habit: they imbibed or inhaled, throughpipes of clay or wood, the smoke of the burning leaves of a herb,which they called pipe-weed or leaf, a variety probably of Nicotiana.A great deal of mystery surrounds the origin of this peculiar custom,or ‘art’ as the Hobbits preferred to call it. All that could be discoveredabout it in antiquity was put together by Meriadoc Brandybuck (laterMaster of Buckland), and since he and the tobacco of the Southfarthing play a part in the history that follows, his remarks in the introduction to his Herblore of the Shire may be quoted.‘This,’ he says, ‘is the one art that we can certainly claim to beour own invention. When Hobbits first began to smoke is not known,all the legends and family histories take it for granted; for ages folkin the Shire smoked various herbs, some fouler, some sweeter. Butall accounts agree that Tobold Hornblower of Longbottom in theSouthfarthing first grew the true pipe-weed in his gardens in the daysof Isengrim the Second, about the year 1070 of Shire-reckoning. Thebest home-grown still comes from that district, especially the varietiesnow known as Longbottom Leaf, Old Toby, and Southern Star.‘How Old Toby came by the plant is not recorded, for to his dyingday he would not tell. He knew much about herbs, but he was notraveller. It is said that in his youth he went often to Bree, thoughhe certainly never went further from the Shire than that. It is thusquite possible that he learned of this plant in Bree, where now, atany rate, it grows well on the south slopes of the hill. The Bree-hobbitsclaim to have been the first actual smokers of the pipe-weed. Theyclaim, of course, to have done everything before the people of theShire, whom they refer to as ‘‘colonists’’; but in this case their claimis, I think, likely to be true. And certainly it was from Bree that theart of smoking the genuine weed spread in the recent centuries amongDwarves and such other folk, Rangers, Wizards, or wanderers, as stillpassed to and fro through that ancient road-meeting. The home andcentre of the art is thus to be found in the old inn of Bree, ThePrancing Pony, that has been kept by the family of Butterbur fromtime beyond record.‘All the same, observations that I have made on my own manyjourneys south have convinced me that the weed itself is not nativeto our parts of the world, but came northward from the lower Anduin,whither it was, I suspect, originally brought over Sea by the Men ofWesternesse. It grows abundantly in Gondor, and there is richer andlarger than in the North, where it is never found wild, and flourishesP R O L OGUE 9only in warm sheltered places like Longbottom. The Men of Gondorcall it sweet galenas, and esteem it only for the fragrance of its flowers.From that land it must have been carried up the Greenway duringthe long centuries between the coming of Elendil and our own days.But even the Du´nedain of Gondor allow us this credit: Hobbits firstput it into pipes. Not even the Wizards first thought of that beforewe did. Though one Wizard that I knew took up the art long ago,and became as skilful in it as in all other things that he put hismind to.’3Of the Ordering of the ShireThe Shire was divided into four quarters, the Farthings alreadyreferred to, North, South, East, and West; and these again each intoa number of folklands, which still bore the names of some of the oldleading families, although by the time of this history these nameswere no longer found only in their proper folklands. Nearly all Tooksstill lived in the Tookland, but that was not true of many otherfamilies, such as the Bagginses or the Boffins. Outside the Farthingswere the East and West Marches: the Buckland (p. 98); and theWestmarch added to the Shire in S.R. 1452.The Shire at this time had hardly any ‘government’. Families forthe most part managed their own affairs. Growing food and eatingit occupied most of their time. In other matters they were, as a rule,generous and not greedy, but contented and moderate, so that estates,farms, workshops, and small trades tended to remain unchanged forgenerations.There remained, of course, the ancient tradition concerning thehigh king at Fornost, or Norbury as they called it, away north of theShire. But there had been no king for nearly a thousand years, andeven the ruins of Kings’ Norbury were covered with grass. Yet theHobbits still said of wild folk and wicked things (such as trolls) thatthey had not heard of the king. For they attributed to the king of oldall their essential laws; and usually they kept the laws of free will,because they were The Rules (as they said), both ancient and just.It is true that the Took family had long been pre-eminent; for theoffice of Thain had passed to them (from the Oldbucks) some centuries before, and the chief Took had borne that title ever since.The Thain was the master of the Shire-moot, and captain of theShire-muster and the Hobbitry-in-arms; but as muster and mootwere only held in times of emergency, which no longer occurred, theThainship had ceased to be more than a nominal dignity. The Tookfamily was still, indeed, accorded a special respect, for it remained10 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSboth numerous and exceedingly wealthy, and was liable to producein every generation strong characters of peculiar habits and evenadventurous temperament. The latter qualities, however, were nowrather tolerated (in the rich) than generally approved. The customendured, nonetheless, of referring to the head of the family as TheTook, and of adding to his name, if required, a number: such asIsengrim the Second, for instance.The only real official in the Shire at this date was the Mayor ofMichel Delving (or of the Shire), who was elected every seven yearsat the Free Fair on the White Downs at the Lithe, that is at Midsummer. As mayor almost his only duty was to preside at banquets,given on the Shire-holidays, which occurred at frequent intervals.But the offices of Postmaster and First Shirriff were attached to themayoralty, so that he managed both the Messenger Service and theWatch. These were the only Shire-services, and the Messengers werethe most numerous, and much the busier of the two. By no meansall Hobbits were lettered, but those who were wrote constantly to alltheir friends (and a selection of their relations) who lived further offthan an afternoon’s walk.The Shirriffs was the name that the Hobbits gave to their police,or the nearest equivalent that they possessed. They had, of course,no uniforms (such things being quite unknown), only a feather intheir caps; and they were in practice rather haywards than policemen,more concerned with the strayings of beasts than of people. Therewere in all the Shire only twelve of them, three in each Farthing, forInside Work. A rather larger body, varying at need, was employedto ‘beat the bounds’, and to see that Outsiders of any kind, great orsmall, did not make themselves a nuisance.At the time when this story begins the Bounders, as they werecalled, had been greatly increased. There were many reports andcomplaints of strange persons and creatures prowling about theborders, or over them: the first sign that all was not quite as it shouldbe, and always had been except in tales and legends of long ago. Fewheeded the sign, and not even Bilbo yet had any notion of what itportended. Sixty years had passed since he set out on his memorablejourney, and he was old even for Hobbits, who reached a hundredas often as not; but much evidently still remained of the considerablewealth that he had brought back. How much or how little he revealedto no one, not even to Frodo his favourite ‘nephew’. And he stillkept secret the ring that he had found.P R O L OGUE 114Of the Finding of the RingAs is told in The Hobbit, there came one day to Bilbo’s door the greatWizard, Gandalf the Grey, and thirteen dwarves with him: noneother, indeed, than Thorin Oakenshield, descendant of kings, andhis twelve companions in exile. With them he set out, to his ownlasting astonishment, on a morning of April, it being then the year1341 Shire-reckoning, on a quest of great treasure, the dwarf-hoardsof the Kings under the Mountain, beneath Erebor in Dale, far off inthe East. The quest was successful, and the Dragon that guarded thehoard was destroyed. Yet, though before all was won the Battle ofFive Armies was fought, and Thorin was slain, and many deeds ofrenown were done, the matter would scarcely have concerned laterhistory, or earned more than a note in the long annals of the ThirdAge, but for an ‘accident’ by the way. The party was assailed byOrcs in a high pass of the Misty Mountains as they went towardsWilderland; and so it happened that Bilbo was lost for a while in theblack orc-mines deep under the mountains, and there, as he gropedin vain in the dark, he put his hand on a ring, lying on the floor ofa tunnel. He put it in his pocket. It seemed then like mere luck.Trying to find his way out, Bilbo went on down to the roots ofthe mountains, until he could go no further. At the bottom of thetunnel lay a cold lake far from the light, and on an island of rock in thewater lived Gollum. He was a loathsome little creature: he paddled asmall boat with his large flat feet, peering with pale luminous eyesand catching blind fish with his long fingers, and eating them raw.He ate any living thing, even orc, if he could catch it and strangle itwithout a struggle. He possessed a secret treasure that had come tohim long ages ago, when he still lived in the light: a ring of gold thatmade its wearer invisible. It was the one thing he loved, his ‘Precious’,and he talked to it, even when it was not with him. For he kept ithidden safe in a hole on his island, except when he was hunting orspying on the orcs of the mines.Maybe he would have attacked Bilbo at once, if the ring had beenon him when they met; but it was not, and the hobbit held in hishand an Elvish knife, which served him as a sword. So to gain timeGollum challenged Bilbo to the Riddle-game, saying that if he askeda riddle which Bilbo could not guess, then he would kill him and eathim; but if Bilbo defeated him, then he would do as Bilbo wished:he would lead him to a way out of the tunnels.Since he was lost in the dark without hope, and could neither goon nor back, Bilbo accepted the challenge; and they asked one anothermany riddles. In the end Bilbo won the game, more by luck (as it12 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSseemed) than by wits; for he was stumped at last for a riddle to ask,and cried out, as his hand came upon the ring he had picked up andforgotten: What have I got in my pocket? This Gollum failed to answer,though he demanded three guesses.The Authorities, it is true, differ whether this last question was amere ‘question’ and not a ‘riddle’ according to the strict rules of theGame; but all agree that, after accepting it and trying to guess theanswer, Gollum was bound by his promise. And Bilbo pressed himto keep his word; for the thought came to him that this slimy creaturemight prove false, even though such promises were held sacred, andof old all but the wickedest things feared to break them. But afterages alone in the dark Gollum’s heart was black, and treachery wasin it. He slipped away, and returned to his island, of which Bilboknew nothing, not far off in the dark water. There, he thought, layhis ring. He was hungry now, and angry, and once his ‘Precious’ waswith him he would not fear any weapon at all.But the ring was not on the island; he had lost it, it was gone.His screech sent a shiver down Bilbo’s back, though he did not yetunderstand what had happened. But Gollum had at last leaped to aguess, too late. What has it got in its pocketses? he cried. The light inhis eyes was like a green flame as he sped back to murder the hobbitand recover his ‘Precious’. Just in time Bilbo saw his peril, and hefled blindly up the passage away from the water; and once more hewas saved by his luck. For as he ran he put his hand in his pocket,and the ring slipped quietly on to his finger. So it was that Gollumpassed him without seeing him, and went to guard the way out, lestthe ‘thief’ should escape. Warily Bilbo followed him, as he wentalong, cursing, and talking to himself about his ‘Precious’; from whichtalk at last even Bilbo guessed the truth, and hope came to him inthe darkness: he himself had found the marvellous ring and a chanceof escape from the orcs and from Gollum.At length they came to a halt before an unseen opening that ledto the lower gates of the mines, on the eastward side of the mountains.There Gollum crouched at bay, smelling and listening; and Bilbowas tempted to slay him with his sword. But pity stayed him, andthough he kept the ring, in which his only hope lay, he would notuse it to help him kill the wretched creature at a disadvantage. In theend, gathering his courage, he leaped over Gollum in the dark, andfled away down the passage, pursued by his enemy’s cries of hateand despair: Thief, thief! Baggins! We hates it for ever!Now it is a curious fact that this is not the story as Bilbo first toldit to his companions. To them his account was that Gollum hadpromised to give him a present, if he won the game; but when GollumP R O L OGUE 13went to fetch it from his island he found the treasure was gone: amagic ring, which had been given to him long ago on his birthday.Bilbo guessed that this was the very ring that he had found, and ashe had won the game, it was already his by right. But being in a tightplace, he said nothing about it, and made Gollum show him the wayout, as a reward instead of a present. This account Bilbo set downin his memoirs, and he seems never to have altered it himself, noteven after the Council of Elrond. Evidently it still appeared in theoriginal Red Book, as it did in several of the copies and abstracts.But many copies contain the true account (as an alternative), derivedno doubt from notes by Frodo or Samwise, both of whom learnedthe truth, though they seem to have been unwilling to delete anythingactually written by the old hobbit himself.Gandalf, however, disbelieved Bilbo’s first story, as soon as heheard it, and he continued to be very curious about the ring. Eventually he got the true tale out of Bilbo after much questioning, whichfor a while strained their friendship; but the wizard seemed to thinkthe truth important. Though he did not say so to Bilbo, he alsothought it important, and disturbing, to find that the good hobbithad not told the truth from the first: quite contrary to his habit. Theidea of a ‘present’ was not mere hobbitlike invention, all the same.It was suggested to Bilbo, as he confessed, by Gollum’s talk that heoverheard; for Gollum did, in fact, call the ring his ‘birthday-present’,many times. That also Gandalf thought strange and suspicious; buthe did not discover the truth in this point for many more years, aswill be seen in this book.Of Bilbo’s later adventures little more need be said here. With thehelp of the ring he escaped from the orc-guards at the gate andrejoined his companions. He used the ring many times on his quest,chiefly for the help of his friends; but he kept it secret from them aslong as he could. After his return to his home he never spoke of itagain to anyone, save Gandalf and Frodo; and no one else in theShire knew of its existence, or so he believed. Only to Frodo did heshow the account of his Journey that he was writing.His sword, Sting, Bilbo hung over his fireplace, and his coat ofmarvellous mail, the gift of the Dwarves from the Dragon-hoard, helent to a museum, to the Michel Delving Mathom-house in fact. Buthe kept in a drawer at Bag End the old cloak and hood that he hadworn on his travels; and the ring, secured by a fine chain, remainedin his pocket.He returned to his home at Bag End on June the 22nd in hisfifty-second year (S.R. 1342), and nothing very notable occurred inthe Shire until Mr. Baggins began the preparations for the celebration14 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSof his hundred-and-eleventh birthday (S.R. 1401). At this point thisHistory begins.NOTE ON THE SHIRE RECORDSAt the end of the Third Age the part played by the Hobbits in thegreat events that led to the inclusion of the Shire in the ReunitedKingdom awakened among them a more widespread interest in theirown history; and many of their traditions, up to that time still mainlyoral, were collected and written down. The greater families were alsoconcerned with events in the Kingdom at large, and many of theirmembers studied its ancient histories and legends. By the end of thefirst century of the Fourth Age there were already to be found inthe Shire several libraries that contained many historical books andrecords.The largest of these collections were probably at Undertowers, atGreat Smials, and at Brandy Hall. This account of the end of theThird Age is drawn mainly from the Red Book of Westmarch. Thatmost important source for the history of the War of the Ring was socalled because it was long preserved at Undertowers, the home ofthe Fairbairns, Wardens of the Westmarch.* It was in origin Bilbo’sprivate diary, which he took with him to Rivendell. Frodo broughtit back to the Shire, together with many loose leaves of notes, andduring S.R. 1420–1 he nearly filled its pages with his account of theWar. But annexed to it and preserved with it, probably in a singlered case, were the three large volumes, bound in red leather, thatBilbo gave to him as a parting gift. To these four volumes there wasadded in Westmarch a fifth containing commentaries, genealogies,and various other matter concerning the hobbit members of theFellowship.The original Red Book has not been preserved, but many copieswere made, especially of the first volume, for the use of the descendants of the children of Master Samwise. The most important copy,however, has a different history. It was kept at Great Smials, but itwas written in Gondor, probably at the request of the great-grandsonof Peregrin, and completed in S.R. 1592 (F.A. 172). Its southernscribe appended this note: Findegil, King’s Writer, finished this workin IV 172. It is an exact copy in all details of the Thain’s Book inMinas Tirith. That book was a copy, made at the request of KingElessar, of the Red Book of the Periannath, and was brought to himby the Thain Peregrin when he retired to Gondor in IV 64.The Thain’s Book was thus the first copy made of the Red Book* See Appendix B: annals 1451, 1462, 1482; and note at end of Appendix C.P R O L OGUE 15and contained much that was later omitted or lost. In Minas Tirithit received much annotation, and many corrections, especially ofnames, words, and quotations in the Elvish languages; and there wasadded to it an abbreviated version of those parts of The Tale of Aragornand Arwen which lie outside the account of the War. The full tale isstated to have been written by Barahir, grandson of the StewardFaramir, some time after the passing of the King. But the chiefimportance of Findegil’s copy is that it alone contains the whole ofBilbo’s ‘Translations from the Elvish’. These three volumes werefound to be a work of great skill and learning in which, between 1403and 1418, he had used all the sources available to him in Rivendell,both living and written. But since they were little used by Frodo,being almost entirely concerned with the Elder Days, no more is saidof them here.Since Meriadoc and Peregrin became the heads of their greatfamilies, and at the same time kept up their connexions with Rohanand Gondor, the libraries at Bucklebury and Tuckborough containedmuch that did not appear in the Red Book. In Brandy Hall therewere many works dealing with Eriador and the history of Rohan.Some of these were composed or begun by Meriadoc himself, thoughin the Shire he was chiefly remembered for his Herblore of the Shire,and for his Reckoning of Years in which he discussed the relation ofthe calendars of the Shire and Bree to those of Rivendell, Gondor,and Rohan. He also wrote a short treatise on Old Words and Namesin the Shire, showing special interest in discovering the kinship withthe language of the Rohirrim of such ‘shire-words’ as mathom andold elements in place names.At Great Smials the books were of less interest to Shire-folk,though more important for larger history. None of them was writtenby Peregrin, but he and his successors collected many manuscriptswritten by scribes of Gondor: mainly copies or summaries of historiesor legends relating to Elendil and his heirs. Only here in the Shirewere to be found extensive materials for the history of Nu´menor andthe arising of Sauron. It was probably at Great Smials that The Taleof Years* was put together, with the assistance of material collectedby Meriadoc. Though the dates given are often conjectural, especiallyfor the Second Age, they deserve attention. It is probable that Meriadoc obtained assistance and information from Rivendell, which hevisited more than once. There, though Elrond had departed, his sonslong remained, together with some of the High-elven folk. It is saidthat Celeborn went to dwell there after the departure of Galadriel;* Represented in much reduced form in Appendix B as far as the end of the ThirdAge.16 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSbut there is no record of the day when at last he sought the GreyHavens, and with him went the last living memory of the Elder Daysin Middle-earth.THE FELLOWSHIPO F THE RINGBEING THE FIRST PART OFThe Lord of the Rings.BOOK ONE.Chapter 1A LONG-EXPECTED PARTYWhen Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortlybe celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonderof the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearanceand unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from histravels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed,whatever the old folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full oftunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough for fame,there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but itseemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much thesame as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved; butunchanged would have been nearer the mark. There were some thatshook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; itseemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetualyouth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.‘It will have to be paid for,’ they said. ‘It isn’t natural, and troublewill come of it!’But so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generouswith his money, most people were willing to forgive him his odditiesand his good fortune. He remained on visiting terms with his relatives(except, of course, the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families.But he had no close friends, until some of his younger cousins beganto grow up.The eldest of these, and Bilbo’s favourite, was young FrodoBaggins. When Bilbo was ninety-nine he adopted Frodo as his heir,and brought him to live at Bag End; and the hopes of the SackvilleBagginses were finally dashed. Bilbo and Frodo happened to havethe same birthday, September 22nd. ‘You had better come and livehere, Frodo my lad,’ said Bilbo one day; ‘and then we can celebrateour birthday-parties comfortably together.’ At that time Frodo wasstill in his tweens, as the hobbits called the irresponsible twentiesbetween childhood and coming of age at thirty-three.Twelve more years passed. Each year the Bagginses had givenvery lively combined birthday-parties at Bag End; but now it was22 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSunderstood that something quite exceptional was being planned forthat autumn. Bilbo was going to be eleventy-one, 111, a rather curiousnumber, and a very respectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himselfhad only reached 130); and Frodo was going to be thirty-three, 33, animportant number: the date of his ‘coming of age’.Tongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour ofthe coming event travelled all over the Shire. The history and character of Mr. Bilbo Baggins became once again the chief topic of conversation; and the older folk suddenly found their reminiscences inwelcome demand.No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee,commonly known as the Gaffer. He held forth at The Ivy Bush, asmall inn on the Bywater road; and he spoke with some authority,for he had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years, and hadhelped old Holman in the same job before that. Now that he washimself growing old and stiff in the joints, the job was mainly carriedon by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father and son were onvery friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo. They lived on the Hillitself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End.‘A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo, as I’ve alwayssaid,’ the Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo was verypolite to him, calling him ‘Master Hamfast’, and consulting himconstantly upon the growing of vegetables – in the matter of ‘roots’,especially potatoes, the Gaffer was recognized as the leading authorityby all in the neighbourhood (including himself).‘But what about this Frodo that lives with him?’ asked Old Noakesof Bywater. ‘Baggins is his name, but he’s more than half a Brandybuck, they say. It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should golooking for a wife away there in Buckland, where folks are so queer.’‘And no wonder they’re queer,’ put in Daddy Twofoot (theGaffer’s next-door neighbour), ‘if they live on the wrong side of theBrandywine River, and right agin the Old Forest. That’s a dark badplace, if half the tales be true.’‘You’re right, Dad!’ said the Gaffer. ‘Not that the Brandybucksof Buckland live in the Old Forest; but they’re a queer breed, seemingly. They fool about with boats on that big river – and that isn’tnatural. Small wonder that trouble came of it, I say. But be that asit may, Mr. Frodo is as nice a young hobbit as you could wish tomeet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo, and in more than looks. After allhis father was a Baggins. A decent respectable hobbit was Mr. DrogoBaggins; there was never much to tell of him, till he was drownded.’‘Drownded?’ said several voices. They had heard this and otherdarker rumours before, of course; but hobbits have a passion forfamily history, and they were ready to hear it again.A L O NG-EX PECTE D PART Y 23‘Well, so they say,’ said the Gaffer. ‘You see: Mr. Drogo, hemarried poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She was our Mr. Bilbo’sfirst cousin on the mother’s side (her mother being the youngest ofthe Old Took’s daughters); and Mr. Drogo was his second cousin.So Mr. Frodo is his first and second cousin, once removed eitherway, as the saying is, if you follow me. And Mr. Drogo was stayingat Brandy Hall with his father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as heoften did after his marriage (him being partial to his vittles, and oldGorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table); and he went out boatingon the Brandywine River; and he and his wife were drownded, andpoor Mr. Frodo only a child and all.’‘I’ve heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,’said Old Noakes; ‘and it was Drogo’s weight as sunk the boat.’‘And I heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him,’said Sandyman, the Hobbiton miller.‘You shouldn’t listen to all you hear, Sandyman,’ said the Gaffer,who did not much like the miller. ‘There isn’t no call to go talkingof pushing and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those thatsit still without looking further for the cause of trouble. Anyway:there was this Mr. Frodo left an orphan and stranded, as you mightsay, among those queer Bucklanders, being brought up anyhow inBrandy Hall. A regular warren, by all accounts. Old Master Gorbadocnever had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place. Mr.Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the lad back tolive among decent folk.‘But I reckon it was a nasty knock for those Sackville-Bagginses.They thought they were going to get Bag End, that time when hewent off and was thought to be dead. And then he comes back andorders them off; and he goes on living and living, and never lookinga day older, bless him! And suddenly he produces an heir, and hasall the papers made out proper. The Sackville-Bagginses won’t neversee the inside of Bag End now, or it is to be hoped not.’‘There’s a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell,’said a stranger, a visitor on business from Michel Delving in theWestfarthing. ‘All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed withchests of gold and silver, and jools, by what I’ve heard.’‘Then you’ve heard more than I can speak to,’ answered theGaffer. ‘I know nothing about jools. Mr. Bilbo is free with his money,and there seems no lack of it; but I know of no tunnel-making. I sawMr. Bilbo when he came back, a matter of sixty years ago, when Iwas a lad. I’d not long come prentice to old Holman (him being mydad’s cousin), but he had me up at Bag End helping him to keepfolks from trampling and trapessing all over the garden while the salewas on. And in the middle of it all Mr. Bilbo comes up the Hill with24 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSa pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests. I don’tdoubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreignparts, where there be mountains of gold, they say; but there wasn’tenough to fill tunnels. But my lad Sam will know more about that.He’s in and out of Bag End. Crazy about stories of the old days, heis, and he listens to all Mr. Bilbo’s tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned himhis letters – meaning no harm, mark you, and I hope no harm willcome of it.‘Elves and Dragons! I says to him. Cabbages and potatoes are betterfor me and you. Don’t go getting mixed up in the business of your betters,or you’ll land in trouble too big for you, I says to him. And I might sayit to others,’ he added with a look at the stranger and the miller.But the Gaffer did not convince his audience. The legend ofBilbo’s wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the youngergeneration of hobbits.‘Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought atfirst,’ argued the miller, voicing common opinion. ‘He’s often awayfrom home. And look at the outlandish folk that visit him: dwarvescoming at night, and that old wandering conjuror, Gandalf, and all.You can say what you like, Gaffer, but Bag End’s a queer place, andits folk are queerer.’‘And you can say what you like, about what you know no moreof than you do of boating, Mr. Sandyman,’ retorted the Gaffer, disliking the miller even more than usual. ‘If that’s being queer, then wecould do with a bit more queerness in these parts. There’s some notfar away that wouldn’t offer a pint of beer to a friend, if they livedin a hole with golden walls. But they do things proper at Bag End.Our Sam says that everyone’s going to be invited to the party, andthere’s going to be presents, mark you, presents for all – this verymonth as is.’That very month was September, and as fine as you could ask. Aday or two later a rumour (probably started by the knowledgeableSam) was spread about that there were going to be fireworks – fireworks, what is more, such as had not been seen in the Shire for nighon a century, not indeed since the Old Took died.Days passed and The Day drew nearer. An odd-looking waggonladen with odd-looking packages rolled into Hobbiton one eveningand toiled up the Hill to Bag End. The startled hobbits peered outof lamplit doors to gape at it. It was driven by outlandish folk, singingstrange songs: dwarves with long beards and deep hoods. A few ofthem remained at Bag End. At the end of the second week in September a cart came in through Bywater from the direction of Brandywine Bridge in broad daylight. An old man was driving it all alone.A L O NG-EX PECTE D PART Y 25He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a silver scarf.He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyondthe brim of his hat. Small hobbit-children ran after the cart all throughHobbiton and right up the hill. It had a cargo of fireworks, as theyrightly guessed. At Bilbo’s front door the old man began to unload:there were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, eachlabelled with a large red G and the elf-rune, .That was Gandalf’s mark, of course, and the old man was Gandalfthe Wizard, whose fame in the Shire was due mainly to his skill withfires, smokes, and lights. His real business was far more difficult anddangerous, but the Shire-folk knew nothing about it. To them hewas just one of the ‘attractions’ at the Party. Hence the excitementof the hobbit-children. ‘G for Grand!’ they shouted, and the old mansmiled. They knew him by sight, though he only appeared in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long; but neither they nor anybut the oldest of their elders had seen one of his firework displays –they now belonged to a legendary past.When the old man, helped by Bilbo and some dwarves, hadfinished unloading, Bilbo gave a few pennies away; but not a singlesquib or cracker was forthcoming, to the disappointment of theonlookers.‘Run away now!’ said Gandalf. ‘You will get plenty when the timecomes.’ Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo, and the door wasshut. The young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while, andthen made off, feeling that the day of the party would never come.Inside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open windowof a small room looking out west on to the garden. The late afternoonwas bright and peaceful. The flowers glowed red and golden: snapdragons and sunflowers, and nasturtians trailing all over the turf wallsand peeping in at the round windows.‘How bright your garden looks!’ said Gandalf.‘Yes,’ said Bilbo. ‘I am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dearold Shire; but I think I need a holiday.’‘You mean to go on with your plan then?’‘I do. I made up my mind months ago, and I haven’t changed it.’‘Very well. It is no good saying any more. Stick to your plan –your whole plan, mind – and I hope it will turn out for the best, foryou, and for all of us.’‘I hope so. Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday, and havemy little joke.’‘Who will laugh, I wonder?’ said Gandalf, shaking his head.‘We shall see,’ said Bilbo.* * *26 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSThe next day more carts rolled up the Hill, and still more carts.There might have been some grumbling about ‘dealing locally’, butthat very week orders began to pour out of Bag End for every kindof provision, commodity, or luxury that could be obtained in Hobbiton or Bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood. People becameenthusiastic; and they began to tick off the days on the calendar; andthey watched eagerly for the postman, hoping for invitations.Before long the invitations began pouring out, and the Hobbitonpost-office was blocked, and the Bywater post-office was snowedunder, and voluntary assistant postmen were called for. There was aconstant stream of them going up the Hill, carrying hundreds ofpolite variations on Thank you, I shall certainly come.A notice appeared on the gate at Bag End: no admittanceexcept on party business. Even those who had, or pretended tohave Party Business were seldom allowed inside. Bilbo was busy:writing invitations, ticking off answers, packing up presents, andmaking some private preparations of his own. From the time ofGandalf’s arrival he remained hidden from view.One morning the hobbits woke to find the large field, south ofBilbo’s front door, covered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilions. A special entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road,and wide steps and a large white gate were built there. The threehobbit-families of Bagshot Row, adjoining the field, were intenselyinterested and generally envied. Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped evenpretending to work in his garden.The tents began to go up. There was a specially large pavilion, sobig that the tree that grew in the field was right inside it, and stoodproudly near one end, at the head of the chief table. Lanterns werehung on all its branches. More promising still (to the hobbits’ mind):an enormous open-air kitchen was erected in the north corner of thefield. A draught of cooks, from every inn and eating-house for milesaround, arrived to supplement the dwarves and other odd folk thatwere quartered at Bag End. Excitement rose to its height.Then the weather clouded over. That was on Wednesday the eveof the Party. Anxiety was intense. Then Thursday, September the22nd, actually dawned. The sun got up, the clouds vanished, flagswere unfurled and the fun began.Bilbo Baggins called it a party, but it was really a variety of entertainments rolled into one. Practically everybody living near wasinvited. A very few were overlooked by accident, but as they turnedup all the same, that did not matter. Many people from other partsof the Shire were also asked; and there were even a few from outsidethe borders. Bilbo met the guests (and additions) at the new whitegate in person. He gave away presents to all and sundry – the latterA L O NG-EX PECTE D PART Y 27were those who went out again by a back way and came in again bythe gate. Hobbits give presents to other people on their own birthdays.Not very expensive ones, as a rule, and not so lavishly as on thisoccasion; but it was not a bad system. Actually in Hobbiton andBywater every day in the year was somebody’s birthday, so that everyhobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at leastonce a week. But they never got tired of them.On this occasion the presents were unusually good. The hobbitchildren were so excited that for a while they almost forgot abouteating. There were toys the like of which they had never seen before,all beautiful and some obviously magical. Many of them had indeedbeen ordered a year before, and had come all the way from theMountain and from Dale, and were of real dwarf-make.When every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside thegate, there were songs, dances, music, games, and, of course, foodand drink. There were three official meals: lunch, tea, and dinner(or supper). But lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact thatat those times all the guests were sitting down and eating together.At other times there were merely lots of people eating and drinking–continuously from elevenses until six-thirty, when the fireworksstarted.The fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought byhim, but designed and made by him; and the special effects, setpieces, and flights of rockets were let off by him. But there was alsoa generous distribution of squibs, crackers, backarappers, sparklers,torches, dwarf-candles, elf-fountains, goblin-barkers and thunderclaps. They were all superb. The art of Gandalf improved with age.There were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing withsweet voices. There were green trees with trunks of dark smoke: theirleaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment, and theirshining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonishedhobbits, disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched theirupturned faces. There were fountains of butterflies that flew glitteringinto the trees; there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and turnedinto eagles, or sailing ships, or a phalanx of flying swans; there wasa red thunderstorm and a shower of yellow rain; there was a forestof silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like anembattled army, and came down again into the Water with a hisslike a hundred hot snakes. And there was also one last surprise, inhonour of Bilbo, and it startled the hobbits exceedingly, as Gandalfintended. The lights went out. A great smoke went up. It shapeditself like a mountain seen in the distance, and began to glow at thesummit. It spouted green and scarlet flames. Out flew a red-goldendragon – not life-size, but terribly life-like: fire came from his jaws,28 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGShis eyes glared down; there was a roar, and he whizzed three timesover the heads of the crowd. They all ducked, and many fell flat ontheir faces. The dragon passed like an express train, turned a somersault, and burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion.‘That is the signal for supper!’ said Bilbo. The pain and alarmvanished at once, and the prostrate hobbits leaped to their feet. Therewas a splendid supper for everyone; for everyone, that is, except thoseinvited to the special family dinner-party. This was held in the greatpavilion with the tree. The invitations were limited to twelve dozen(a number also called by the hobbits one Gross, though the wordwas not considered proper to use of people); and the guests wereselected from all the families to which Bilbo and Frodo were related,with the addition of a few special unrelated friends (such as Gandalf).Many young hobbits were included, and present by parental permission; for hobbits were easy-going with their children in the matterof sitting up late, especially when there was a chance of getting thema free meal. Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender.There were many Bagginses and Boffins, and also many Tooks andBrandybucks; there were various Grubbs (relations of Bilbo Baggins’grandmother), and various Chubbs (connexions of his Took grandfather); and a selection of Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Brockhouses, Goodbodies, Hornblowers and Proudfoots. Some of thesewere only very distantly connected with Bilbo, and some had hardlyever been in Hobbiton before, as they lived in remote corners of theShire. The Sackville-Bagginses were not forgotten. Otho and his wifeLobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo and detested Frodo, butso magnificent was the invitation card, written in golden ink, thatthey had felt it was impossible to refuse. Besides, their cousin, Bilbo,had been specializing in food for many years and his table had a highreputation.All the one hundred and forty-four guests expected a pleasantfeast; though they rather dreaded the after-dinner speech of theirhost (an inevitable item). He was liable to drag in bits of what hecalled poetry; and sometimes, after a glass or two, would allude tothe absurd adventures of his mysterious journey. The guests werenot disappointed: they had a very pleasant feast, in fact an engrossingentertainment: rich, abundant, varied, and prolonged. The purchaseof provisions fell almost to nothing throughout the district in theensuing weeks; but as Bilbo’s catering had depleted the stocks ofmost of the stores, cellars and warehouses for miles around, that didnot matter much.After the feast (more or less) came the Speech. Most of the company were, however, now in a tolerant mood, at that delightful stagewhich they called ‘filling up the corners’. They were sipping theirA L O NG-EX PECTE D PART Y 29favourite drinks, and nibbling at their favourite dainties, and theirfears were forgotten. They were prepared to listen to anything, andto cheer at every full stop.My dear People, began Bilbo, rising in his place. ‘Hear! Hear! Hear!’they shouted, and kept on repeating it in chorus, seeming reluctantto follow their own advice. Bilbo left his place and went and stoodon a chair under the illuminated tree. The light of the lanterns fellon his beaming face; the golden buttons shone on his embroideredsilk waistcoat. They could all see him standing, waving one hand inthe air, the other was in his trouser-pocket.My dear Bagginses and Boffins, he began again; and my dear Tooksand Brandybucks, and Grubbs, and Chubbs, and Burrowses, and Hornblowers, andBolgers,Bracegirdles,Goodbodies,Brockhouses andProudfoots.‘Proudfeet!’ shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion.His name, of course, was Proudfoot, and well merited; his feet werelarge, exceptionally furry, and both were on the table.Proudfoots, repeated Bilbo. Also my good Sackville-Bagginses that Iwelcome back at last to Bag End. Today is my one hundred and eleventhbirthday: I am eleventy-one today! ‘Hurray! Hurray! Many HappyReturns!’ they shouted, and they hammered joyously on the tables.Bilbo was doing splendidly. This was the sort of stuff they liked:short and obvious.I hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am. Deafeningcheers. Cries of Yes (and No). Noises of trumpets and horns, pipesand flutes, and other musical instruments. There were, as has beensaid, many young hobbits present. Hundreds of musical crackers hadbeen pulled. Most of them bore the mark dale on them; which didnot convey much to most of the hobbits, but they all agreed theywere marvellous crackers. They contained instruments, small, but ofperfect make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one corner some ofthe young Tooks and Brandybucks, supposing Uncle Bilbo to havefinished (since he had plainly said all that was necessary), now gotup an impromptu orchestra, and began a merry dance-tune. MasterEverard Took and Miss Melilot Brandybuck got on a table and withbells in their hands began to dance the Springle-ring: a pretty dance,but rather vigorous.But Bilbo had not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster nearby,he blew three loud hoots. The noise subsided. I shall not keep youlong, he cried. Cheers from all the assembly. I have called you alltogether for a Purpose. Something in the way that he said this madean impression. There was almost silence, and one or two of the Tookspricked up their ears.Indeed, for Three Purposes! First of all, to tell you that I am immenselyfond of you all, and that eleventy-one years is too short a time to live30 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSamong such excellent and admirable hobbits. Tremendous outburst ofapproval.I don’t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like lessthan half of you half as well as you deserve. This was unexpected andrather difficult. There was some scattered clapping, but most of themwere trying to work it out and see if it came to a compliment.Secondly, to celebrate my birthday. Cheers again. I should say: OURbirthday. For it is, of course, also the birthday of my heir and nephew,Frodo. He comes of age and into his inheritance today. Some perfunctoryclapping by the elders; and some loud shouts of ‘Frodo! Frodo! Jollyold Frodo,’ from the juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, andwondered what was meant by ‘coming into his inheritance’.Together we score one hundred and forty-four. Your numbers werechosen to fit this remarkable total: One Gross, if I may use the expression.No cheers. This was ridiculous. Many of the guests, and especiallythe Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted, feeling sure they had onlybeen asked to fill up the required number, like goods in a package.‘One Gross, indeed! Vulgar expression.’It is also, if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history, the anniversaryof my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long Lake; though the factthat it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion. I was onlyfifty-one then, and birthdays did not seem so important. The banquet wasvery splendid, however, though I had a bad cold at the time, I remember,and could only say ‘thag you very buch’. I now repeat it more correctly:Thank you very much for coming to my little party. Obstinate silence.They all feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent; andthey were getting bored. Why couldn’t he stop talking and let themdrink his health? But Bilbo did not sing or recite. He paused for amoment.Thirdly and finally, he said, I wish to make an ANNOUNCEMENT.He spoke this last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat upwho still could. I regret to announce that – though, as I said, eleventy-oneyears is far too short a time to spend among you – this is the END. I amgoing. I am leaving NOW. GOOD-BYE!He stepped down and vanished. There was a blinding flash oflight, and the guests all blinked. When they opened their eyes Bilbowas nowhere to be seen. One hundred and forty-four flabbergastedhobbits sat back speechless. Old Odo Proudfoot removed his feetfrom the table and stamped. Then there was a dead silence, untilsuddenly, after several deep breaths, every Baggins, Boffin, Took,Brandybuck, Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger, Bracegirdle, Brockhouse, Goodbody, Hornblower, and Proudfoot began to talk at once.It was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste, and moreA L O NG-EX PECTE D PART Y 31food and drink were needed to cure the guests ofshock and annoyance.‘He’s mad. I alwayssaid so,’ was probably the most popular comment.Even the Tooks (with a few exceptions) thought Bilbo’s behaviourwas absurd. For the moment most of them took it for granted thathis disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank.But old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure. Neither age nor anenormous dinner had clouded his wits, and he said to his daughter-inlaw, Esmeralda: ‘There’s something fishy in this, my dear! I believethat mad Baggins is off again. Silly old fool. But why worry? Hehasn’t taken the vittles with him.’ He called loudly to Frodo to sendthe wine round again.Frodo was the only one present who had said nothing. For sometime he had sat silent beside Bilbo’s empty chair, and ignored allremarks and questions. He had enjoyed the joke, of course, eventhough he had been in the know. He had difficulty in keeping fromlaughter at the indignant surprise of the guests. But at the sametime he felt deeply troubled: he realized suddenly that he loved theold hobbit dearly. Most of the guests went on eating and drinkingand discussing Bilbo Baggins’ oddities, past and present; but theSackville-Bagginses had already departed in wrath. Frodo did notwant to have any more to do with the party. He gave orders for morewine to be served; then he got up and drained his own glass silentlyto the health of Bilbo, and slipped out of the pavilion.As for Bilbo Baggins, even while he was making his speech, hehad been fingering the golden ring in his pocket: his magic ring thathe had kept secret for so many years. As he stepped down he slippedit on his finger, and he was never seen by any hobbit in Hobbitonagain.He walked briskly back to his hole, and stood for a moment listening with a smile to the din in the pavilion, and to the sounds ofmerrymaking in other parts of the field. Then he went in. He tookoff his party clothes, folded up and wrapped in tissue-paper hisembroidered silk waistcoat, and put it away. Then he put on quicklysome old untidy garments, and fastened round his waist a wornleather belt. On it he hung a short sword in a battered black-leatherscabbard. From a locked drawer, smelling of moth-balls, he took outan old cloak and hood. They had been locked up as if they were veryprecious, but they were so patched and weatherstained that theiroriginal colour could hardly be guessed: it might have been darkgreen. They were rather too large for him. He then went into hisstudy, and from a large strong-box took out a bundle wrapped inold cloths, and a leather-bound manuscript; and also a large bulkyenvelope. The book and bundle he stuffed into the top of a heavy32 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSbag that was standing there, already nearly full. Into the envelope heslipped his golden ring, and its fine chain, and then sealed it, andaddressed it to Frodo. At first he put it on the mantelpiece, butsuddenly he removed it and stuck it in his pocket. At that momentthe door opened and Gandalf came quickly in.‘Hullo!’ said Bilbo. ‘I wondered if you would turn up.’‘I am glad to find you visible,’ replied the wizard, sitting down in achair, ‘I wanted to catch you and have a few final words. I suppose youfeel that everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan?’‘Yes, I do,’ said Bilbo. ‘Though that flash was surprising: it quitestartled me, let alone the others. A little addition of your own, Isuppose?’‘It was. You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years, andit seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else thatwould seem to explain your sudden vanishment.’‘And would spoil my joke. You are an interfering old busybody,’laughed Bilbo, ‘but I expect you know best, as usual.’‘I do – when I know anything. But I don’t feel too sure about thiswhole affair. It has now come to the final point. You have had yourjoke, and alarmed or offended most of your relations, and given thewhole Shire something to talk about for nine days, or ninety-ninemore likely. Are you going any further?’‘Yes, I am. I feel I need a holiday, a very long holiday, as I havetold you before. Probably a permanent holiday: I don’t expect I shallreturn. In fact, I don’t mean to, and I have made all arrangements.‘I am old, Gandalf. I don’t look it, but I am beginning to feel itin my heart of hearts. Well-preserved indeed!’ he snorted. ‘Why, I feelall thin, sort of stretched, if you know what I mean: like butter thathas been scraped over too much bread. That can’t be right. I needa change, or something.’Gandalf looked curiously and closely at him. ‘No, it does notseem right,’ he said thoughtfully. ‘No, after all I believe your plan isprobably the best.’‘Well, I’ve made up my mind, anyway. I want to see mountainsagain, Gandalf – mountains; and then find somewhere where I canrest. In peace and quiet, without a lot of relatives prying around, anda string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell. I might findsomewhere where I can finish my book. I have thought of a niceending for it: and he lived happily ever after to the end of his days.’Gandalf laughed. ‘I hope he will. But nobody will read the book,however it ends.’‘Oh, they may, in years to come. Frodo has read some already, asfar as it has gone. You’ll keep an eye on Frodo, won’t you?’‘Yes, I will – two eyes, as often as I can spare them.’A L O NG-EX PECTE D PART Y 33‘He would come with me, of course, if I asked him. In fact heoffered to once, just before the party. But he does not really wantto, yet. I want to see the wild country again before I die, and theMountains; but he is still in love with the Shire, with woods andfields and little rivers. He ought to be comfortable here. I am leavingeverything to him, of course, except a few oddments. I hope he willbe happy, when he gets used to being on his own. It’s time he washis own master now.’‘Everything?’ said Gandalf. ‘The ring as well? You agreed to that,you remember.’‘Well, er, yes, I suppose so,’ stammered Bilbo.‘Where is it?’‘In an envelope, if you must know,’ said Bilbo impatiently. ‘Thereon the mantelpiece. Well, no! Here it is in my pocket!’ He hesitated.‘Isn’t that odd now?’ he said softly to himself. ‘Yet after all, why not?Why shouldn’t it stay there?’Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo, and there was a gleamin his eyes.‘I think, Bilbo,’ he said quietly, ‘I should leave it behind.Don’t you want to?’‘Well yes – and no. Now it comes to it, I don’t like parting withit at all, I may say. And I don’t really see why I should. Why do youwant me to?’ he asked, and a curious change came over his voice. Itwas sharp with suspicion and annoyance. ‘You are always badgeringme about my ring; but you have never bothered me about the otherthings that I got on my journey.’‘No, but I had to badger you,’ said Gandalf. ‘I wanted the truth.It was important. Magic rings are – well, magical; and they are rareand curious. I was professionally interested in your ring, you maysay; and I still am. I should like to know where it is, if you gowandering again. Also I think you have had it quite long enough.You won’t need it any more, Bilbo, unless I am quite mistaken.’Bilbo flushed, and there was an angry light in his eyes. His kindlyface grew hard. ‘Why not?’ he cried. ‘And what business is it of yours,anyway, to know what I do with my own things? It is my own. Ifound it. It came to me.’‘Yes, yes,’ said Gandalf. ‘But there is no need to get angry.’‘If I am it is your fault,’ said Bilbo. ‘It is mine, I tell you. My own.My Precious. Yes, my Precious.’The wizard’s face remained grave and attentive, and only a flickerin his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed. ‘Ithas been called that before,’ he said, ‘but not by you.’‘But I say it now. And why not? Even if Gollum said the sameonce. It’s not his now, but mine. And I shall keep it, I say.’Gandalf stood up. He spoke sternly. ‘You will be a fool if you do,34 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSBilbo,’ he said. ‘You make that clearer with every word you say. Ithas got far too much hold on you. Let it go! And then you can goyourself, and be free.’‘I’ll do as I choose and go as I please,’ said Bilbo obstinately.‘Now, now, my dear hobbit!’ said Gandalf. ‘All your long life wehave been friends, and you owe me something. Come! Do as youpromised: give it up!’‘Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so!’ cried Bilbo. ‘But youwon’t get it. I won’t give my Precious away, I tell you.’ His handstrayed to the hilt of his small sword.Gandalf’s eyes flashed. ‘It will be my turn to get angry soon,’ hesaid. ‘If you say that again, I shall. Then you will see Gandalf theGrey uncloaked.’ He took a step towards the hobbit, and he seemedto grow tall and menacing; his shadow filled the little room.Bilbo backed away to the wall, breathing hard, his hand clutchingat his pocket. They stood for a while facing one another, and the airof the room tingled. Gandalf’s eyes remained bent on the hobbit.Slowly his hands relaxed, and he began to tremble.‘I don’t know what has come over you, Gandalf,’ he said. ‘Youhave never been like this before. What is it all about? It is mine isn’tit? I found it, and Gollum would have killed me, if I hadn’t kept it.I’m not a thief, whatever he said.’‘I have never called you one,’ Gandalf answered. ‘And I am not oneeither. I am not trying to rob you, but to help you. I wish you wouldtrust me, as you used.’ He turned away, and the shadow passed. Heseemed to dwindle again to an old grey man, bent and troubled.Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes. ‘I am sorry,’ he said. ‘But I feltso queer. And yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered withit any more. It has been so growing on my mind lately. Sometimes Ihave felt it was like an eye looking at me. And I am always wantingto put it on and disappear, don’t you know; or wondering if it is safe,and pulling it out to make sure. I tried locking it up, but I found Icouldn’t rest without it in my pocket. I don’t know why. And I don’tseem able to make up my mind.’‘Then trust mine,’ said Gandalf. ‘It is quite made up. Go awayand leave it behind. Stop possessing it. Give it to Frodo, and I willlook after him.’Bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided. Presently hesighed. ‘All right,’ he said with an effort. ‘I will.’ Then he shruggedhis shoulders, and smiled rather ruefully. ‘After all that’s what thisparty business was all about, really: to give away lots of birthdaypresents, and somehow make it easier to give it away at the sametime. It hasn’t made it any easier in the end, but it would be a pityto waste all my preparations. It would quite spoil the joke.’A L O NG-EX PECTE D PART Y 35‘Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair,’said Gandalf.‘Very well,’ said Bilbo, ‘it goes to Frodo with all the rest.’ He drewa deep breath. ‘And now I really must be starting, or somebody elsewill catch me. I have said good-bye, and I couldn’t bear to do it allover again.’ He picked up his bag and moved to the door.‘You have still got the ring in your pocket,’ said the wizard.‘Well, so I have!’ cried Bilbo. ‘And my will and all the otherdocuments too. You had better take it and deliver it for me. Thatwill be safest.’‘No, don’t give the ring to me,’ said Gandalf. ‘Put it on the mantelpiece.It will be safe enough there, till Frodo comes.Ishall wait for him.’Bilbo took out the envelope, but just as he was about to set it bythe clock, his hand jerked back, and the packet fell on the floor.Before he could pick it up, the wizard stooped and seized it and setit in its place. A spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbit’s faceagain. Suddenly it gave way to a look of relief and a laugh.‘Well, that’s that,’ he said. ‘Now I’m off!’They went out into the hall. Bilbo chose his favourite stick fromthe stand; then he whistled. Three dwarves came out of differentrooms where they had been busy.‘Is everything ready?’ askedBilbo.‘Everything packed and labelled?’‘Everything,’ they answered.‘Well, let’s start then!’ He stepped out of the front-door.It was a fine night, and the black sky was dotted with stars. Helooked up, sniffing the air. ‘What fun! What fun to be off again, offon the Road with dwarves! This is what I have really been longingfor, for years! Good-bye!’ he said, looking at his old home and bowingto the door. ‘Good-bye, Gandalf!’‘Good-bye, for the present, Bilbo. Take care of yourself! You areold enough, and perhaps wise enough.’‘Take care! I don’t care. Don’t you worry about me! I am as happynow as I have ever been, and that is saying a great deal. But the timehas come. I am being swept off my feet at last,’ he added, and thenin a low voice, as if to himself, he sang softly in the dark:The Road goes ever on and onDown from the door where it began.Now far ahead the Road has gone,And I must follow, if I can,Pursuing it with eager feet,Until it joins some larger wayWhere many paths and errands meet.And whither then? I cannot say.36 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSHe paused, silent for a moment. Then without another word heturned away from the lights and voices in the field and tents, andfollowed by his three companions went round into his garden, andtrotted down the long sloping path. He jumped over a low place inthe hedge at the bottom, and took to the meadows, passing into thenight like a rustle of wind in the grass.Gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness.‘Good-bye, my dear Bilbo – until our next meeting!’ he said softlyand went back indoors.Frodo came in soon afterwards, and found him sitting in the dark,deep in thought. ‘Has he gone?’ he asked.‘Yes,’ answered Gandalf, ‘he has gone at last.’‘I wish – I mean, I hoped until this evening that it was only ajoke,’ said Frodo. ‘But I knew in my heart that he really meant togo. He always used to joke about serious things. I wish I had comeback sooner, just to see him off.’‘I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end,’ saidGandalf. ‘Don’t be too troubled. He’ll be all right – now. He left apacket for you. There it is!’Frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece, and glanced at it,but did not open it.‘You’ll find his will and all the other documents in there, I think,’said the wizard. ‘You are the master of Bag End now. And also, Ifancy, you’ll find a golden ring.’‘The ring!’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘Has he left me that? I wonder why.Still, it may be useful.’‘It may, and it may not,’ said Gandalf. ‘I should not make use ofit, if I were you. But keep it secret, and keep it safe! Now I am goingto bed.’As master of Bag End Frodo felt it his painful duty to say good-byeto the guests. Rumours of strange events had by now spread all overthe field, but Frodo would only say no doubt everything will be clearedup in the morning. About midnight carriages came for the importantfolk. One by one they rolled away, filled with full but very unsatisfiedhobbits. Gardeners came by arrangement, and removed in wheelbarrows those that had inadvertently remained behind.Night slowly passed. The sun rose. The hobbits rose rather later.Morning went on. People came and began (by orders) to clear awaythe pavilions and the tables and the chairs, and the spoons and knivesand bottles and plates, and the lanterns, and the flowering shrubs inboxes, and the crumbs and cracker-paper, the forgotten bags andgloves and handkerchiefs, and the uneaten food (a very small item).A L O NG-EX PECTE D PART Y 37Then a number of other people came (without orders): Bagginses,and Boffins, and Bolgers, and Tooks, and other guests that lived orwere staying near. By mid-day, when even the best-fed were out andabout again, there was a large crowd at Bag End, uninvited but notunexpected.Frodo was waiting on the step, smiling, but looking rather tiredand worried. He welcomed all the callers, but he had not much moreto say than before. His reply to all inquiries was simply this: ‘Mr.Bilbo Baggins has gone away; as far as I know, for good.’ Some ofthe visitors he invited to come inside, as Bilbo had left ‘messages’for them.Inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packagesand parcels and small articles of furniture. On every item there wasa label tied. There were several labels of this sort:For ADELARD TOOK, for his VERY OWN, from Bilbo; on anumbrella. Adelard had carried off many unlabelled ones.For DORA BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspondence, withlove from Bilbo; on a large waste-paper basket. Dora was Drogo’ssister and the eldest surviving female relative of Bilbo and Frodo; shewas ninety-nine, and had written reams of good advice for more thanhalf a century.For MILO BURROWS, hoping it will be useful, from B.B.; on agold pen and ink-bottle. Milo never answered letters.For ANGELICA’S use, from Uncle Bilbo; on a round convex mirror.She was a young Baggins, and too obviously considered her faceshapely.For the collection of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE, from a contributor; onan (empty) book-case. Hugo was a great borrower of books, andworse than usual at returning them.For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS, as a PRESENT; on acase of silver spoons. Bilbo believed that she had acquired a goodmany of his spoons, while he was away on his former journey. Lobeliaknew that quite well. When she arrived later in the day, she took thepoint at once, but she also took the spoons.This is only a small selection of the assembled presents. Bilbo’sresidence had got rather cluttered up with things in the course of hislong life. It was a tendency of hobbit-holes to get cluttered up: forwhich the custom of giving so many birthday-presents was largelyresponsible. Not, of course, that the birthday-presents were alwaysnew; there were one or two old mathoms of forgotten uses that hadcirculated all around the district; but Bilbo had usually given newpresents, and kept those that he received. The old hole was nowbeing cleared a little.38 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSEvery one of the various parting gifts had labels, written out personally by Bilbo, and several had some point, or some joke. But, ofcourse, most of the things were given where they would be wantedand welcome. The poorer hobbits, and especially those of BagshotRow, did very well. Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks of potatoes,a new spade, a woollen waistcoat, and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints. Old Rory Brandybuck, in return for much hospitality,got a dozen bottles of Old Winyards: a strong red wine from theSouthfarthing, and now quite mature, as it had been laid down byBilbo’s father. Rory quite forgave Bilbo, and voted him a capitalfellow after the first bottle.There was plenty of everything left for Frodo. And, of course, allthe chief treasures, as well as the books, pictures, and more thanenough furniture, were left in his possession. There was, however,no sign nor mention of money or jewellery: not a penny-piece or aglass bead was given away.Frodo had a very trying time that afternoon. A false rumour thatthe whole household was being distributed free spread like wildfire;and before long the place was packed with people who had nobusiness there, but could not be kept out. Labels got torn off andmixed, and quarrels broke out. Some people tried to do swaps anddeals in the hall; and others tried to make off with minor itemsnot addressed to them, or with anything that seemed unwanted orunwatched. The road to the gate was blocked with barrows andhandcarts.In the middle of the commotion the Sackville-Bagginses arrived.Frodo had retired for a while and left his friend Merry Brandybuckto keep an eye on things. When Otho loudly demanded to see Frodo,Merry bowed politely.‘He is indisposed,’ he said. ‘He is resting.’‘Hiding, you mean,’ said Lobelia. ‘Anyway we want to see himand we mean to see him. Just go and tell him so!’Merry left them a long while in the hall, and they had time todiscover their parting gift of spoons. It did not improve their tempers.Eventually they were shown into the study. Frodo was sitting at atable with a lot of papers in front of him. He looked indisposed – tosee Sackville-Bagginses at any rate; and he stood up, fidgeting withsomething in his pocket. But he spoke quite politely.The Sackville-Bagginses were rather offensive. They began byoffering him bad bargain-prices (as between friends) for various valuable and unlabelled things. When Frodo replied that only the thingsspecially directed by Bilbo were being given away, they said the wholeaffair was very fishy.A L O NG-EX PECTE D PART Y 39‘Only one thing is clear to me,’ said Otho, ‘and that is that youare doing exceedingly well out of it. I insist on seeing the will.’Otho would have been Bilbo’s heir, but for the adoption ofFrodo. He read the will carefully and snorted. It was, unfortunately,very clear and correct (according to the legal customs of hobbits,which demand among other things seven signatures of witnesses inred ink).‘Foiled again!’ he said to his wife. ‘And after waiting sixty years.Spoons? Fiddlesticks!’ He snapped his fingers under Frodo’s noseand stumped off. But Lobelia was not so easily got rid of. A littlelater Frodo came out of the study to see how things were going on,and found her still about the place, investigating nooks and corners,and tapping the floors. He escorted her firmly off the premises, afterhe had relieved her of several small (but rather valuable) articles thathad somehow fallen inside her umbrella. Her face looked as if shewas in the throes of thinking out a really crushing parting remark;but all she found to say, turning round on the step, was:‘You’ll live to regret it, young fellow! Why didn’t you go too? Youdon’t belong here; you’re no Baggins – you – you’re a Brandybuck!’‘Did you hear that, Merry? That was an insult, if you like,’ saidFrodo as he shut the door on her.‘It was a compliment,’ said Merry Brandybuck, ‘and so, of course,not true.’Then they went round the hole, and evicted three young hobbits(two Boffins and a Bolger) who were knocking holes in the walls ofone of the cellars. Frodo also had a tussle with young SanchoProudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot’s grandson), who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry, where he thought there was an echo. Thelegend of Bilbo’s gold excited both curiosity and hope; for legendarygold (mysteriously obtained, if not positively ill-gotten), is, as everyone knows, anyone’s for the finding – unless the search is interrupted.When he had overcome Sancho and pushed him out, Frodo collapsed on a chair in the hall. ‘It’s time to close the shop, Merry,’ hesaid. ‘Lock the door, and don’t open it to anyone today, not even ifthey bring a battering ram.’ Then he went to revive himself with abelated cup of tea.He had hardly sat down, when there came a soft knock at thefront-door. ‘Lobelia again most likely,’ he thought. ‘She must havethought of something really nasty, and have come back again to sayit. It can wait.’He went on with his tea. The knock was repeated, much louder,but he took no notice. Suddenly the wizard’s head appeared at thewindow.40 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGS‘If you don’t let me in, Frodo, I shall blow your door right downyour hole and out through the hill,’ he said.‘My dear Gandalf! Half a minute!’ cried Frodo, running out ofthe room to the door. ‘Come in! Come in! I thought it was Lobelia.’‘Then I forgive you. But I saw her some time ago, driving a ponytrap towards Bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk.’‘She had already nearly curdled me. Honestly, I nearly tried onBilbo’s ring. I longed to disappear.’‘Don’t do that!’ said Gandalf, sitting down. ‘Do be careful of thatring, Frodo! In fact, it is partly about that that I have come to say alast word.’‘Well, what about it?’‘What do you know already?’‘Only what Bilbo told me. I have heard his story: how he foundit, and how he used it: on his journey, I mean.’‘Which story, I wonder,’ said Gandalf.‘Oh, not what he told the dwarves and put in his book,’ said Frodo.‘He told me the true story soon after I came to live here. He saidyou had pestered him till he told you, so I had better know too. ‘‘Nosecrets between us, Frodo,’’ he said; ‘‘but they are not to go anyfurther. It’s mine anyway.’’ ’‘That’s interesting,’ said Gandalf. ‘Well, what did you think of itall?’‘If you mean, inventing all that about a ‘‘present’’, well, I thoughtthe true story much more likely, and I couldn’t see the point ofaltering it at all. It was very unlike Bilbo to do so, anyway; and Ithought it rather odd.’‘So did I. But odd things may happen to people that have suchtreasures – if they use them. Let it be a warning to you to be verycareful with it. It may have other powers than just making you vanishwhen you wish to.’‘I don’t understand,’ said Frodo.‘Neither do I,’ answered the wizard. ‘I have merely begun towonder about the ring, especially since last night. No need to worry.But if you take my advice you will use it very seldom, or not at all.At least I beg you not to use it in any way that will cause talk orrouse suspicion. I say again: keep it safe, and keep it secret!’‘You are very mysterious! What are you afraid of?’‘I am not certain, so I will say no more. I may be able to tell yousomething when I come back. I am going off at once: so this isgood-bye for the present.’ He got up.‘At once!’ cried Frodo. ‘Why, I thought you were staying on forat least a week. I was looking forward to your help.’‘I did mean to – but I have had to change my mind. I may beA L O NG-EX PECTE D PART Y 41away for a good while; but I’ll come and see you again, as soon as Ican. Expect me when you see me! I shall slip in quietly. I shan’t oftenbe visiting the Shire openly again. I find that I have become ratherunpopular. They say I am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace.Some people are actually accusing me of spiriting Bilbo away, orworse. If you want to know, there is supposed to be a plot betweenyou and me to get hold of his wealth.’‘Some people!’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘You mean Otho and Lobelia.How abominable! I would give them Bag End and everything else,if I could get Bilbo back and go off tramping in the country withhim. I love the Shire. But I begin to wish, somehow, that I had gonetoo. I wonder if I shall ever see him again.’‘So do I,’ said Gandalf. ‘And I wonder many other things. Goodbye now! Take care of yourself! Look out for me, especially at unlikelytimes! Good-bye!’Frodo saw him to the door. He gave a final wave of his hand, andwalked off at a surprising pace; but Frodo thought the old wizardlooked unusually bent, almost as if he was carrying a great weight.The evening was closing in, and his cloaked figure quickly vanishedinto the twilight. Frodo did not see him again for a long time.Chapter 2THE SHADOW O F THE PASTThe talk did not die down in nine or even ninety-nine days. Thesecond disappearance of Mr. Bilbo Baggins was discussed in Hobbiton, and indeed all over the Shire, for a year and a day, and wasremembered much longer than that. It became a fireside-story foryoung hobbits; and eventually Mad Baggins, who used to vanish witha bang and a flash and reappear with bags of jewels and gold, becamea favourite character of legend and lived on long after all the trueevents were forgotten.But in the meantime, the general opinion in the neighbourhoodwas that Bilbo, who had always been rather cracked, had at last gonequite mad, and had run off into the Blue. There he had undoubtedlyfallen into a pool or a river and come to a tragic, but hardly anuntimely, end. The blame was mostly laid on Gandalf.‘If only that dratted wizard will leave young Frodo alone, perhapshe’ll settle down and grow some hobbit-sense,’ they said. And to allappearance the wizard did leave Frodo alone, and he did settle down,but the growth of hobbit-sense was not very noticeable. Indeed, heat once began to carry on Bilbo’s reputation for oddity. He refusedto go into mourning; and the next year he gave a party in honour ofBilbo’s hundred-and-twelfth birthday, which he called a Hundredweight Feast. But that was short of the mark, for twenty guests wereinvited and there were several meals at which it snowed food andrained drink, as hobbits say.Some people were rather shocked; but Frodo kept up the customof giving Bilbo’s Birthday Party year after year until they got used toit. He said that he did not think Bilbo was dead. When they asked:‘Where is he then?’ he shrugged his shoulders.He lived alone, as Bilbo had done; but he had a good manyfriends, especially among the younger hobbits (mostly descendants of the Old Took) who had as children been fond of Bilbo andoften in and out of Bag End. Folco Boffin and Fredegar Bolgerwere two of these; but his closest friends were Peregrin Took(usually called Pippin), and Merry Brandybuck (his real name wasMeriadoc, but that was seldom remembered). Frodo went trampingover the Shire with them; but more often he wandered by himself,and to the amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen farfrom home walking in the hills and woods under the starlight. MerryT HE SHADOW O F TH E PAST 43and Pippin suspected that he visited the Elves at times, as Bilbo haddone.As time went on, people began to notice that Frodo also showedsigns of good ‘preservation’: outwardly he retained the appearanceof a robust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens. ‘Some folkhave all the luck,’ they said; but it was not until Frodo approachedthe usually more sober age of fifty that they began to think it queer.Frodo himself, after the first shock, found that being his ownmaster and the Mr. Baggins of Bag End was rather pleasant. Forsome years he was quite happy and did not worry much about thefuture. But half unknown to himself the regret that he had not gonewith Bilbo was steadily growing. He found himself wondering attimes, especially in the autumn, about the wild lands, and strangevisions of mountains that he had never seen came into his dreams.He began to say to himself: ‘Perhaps I shall cross the River myself oneday.’ To which the other half of his mind always replied: ‘Not yet.’So it went on, until his forties were running out, and his fiftiethbirthday was drawing near: fifty was a number that he felt was somehow significant (or ominous); it was at any rate at that age thatadventure had suddenly befallen Bilbo. Frodo began to feel restless,and the old paths seemed too well-trodden. He looked at maps, andwondered what lay beyond their edges: maps made in the Shireshowed mostly white spaces beyond its borders. He took to wanderingfurther afield and more often by himself; and Merry and his otherfriends watched him anxiously. Often he was seen walking and talkingwith the strange wayfarers that began at this time to appear in theShire.There were rumours of strange things happening in the worldoutside; and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent anymessage for several years, Frodo gathered all the news he could.Elves, who seldom walked in the Shire, could now be seen passingwestward through the woods in the evening, passing and notreturning; but they were leaving Middle-earth and were no longerconcerned with its troubles. There were, however, dwarves on theroad in unusual numbers. The ancient East–West Road ran throughthe Shire to its end at the Grey Havens, and dwarves had alwaysused it on their way to their mines in the Blue Mountains. They werethe hobbits’ chief source of news from distant parts – if they wantedany: as a rule dwarves said little and hobbits asked no more. But nowFrodo often met strange dwarves of far countries, seeking refuge inthe West. They were troubled, and some spoke in whispers of theEnemy and of the Land of Mordor.44 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSThat name the hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past, likea shadow in the background of their memories; but it was ominousand disquieting. It seemed that the evil power in Mirkwood had beendriven out by the White Council only to reappear in greater strengthin the old strongholds of Mordor. The Dark Tower had been rebuilt,it was said. From there the power was spreading far and wide, andaway far east and south there were wars and growing fear. Orcs weremultiplying again in the mountains. Trolls were abroad, no longerdull-witted, but cunning and armed with dreadful weapons. Andthere were murmured hints of creatures more terrible than all these,but they had no name.Little of all this, of course, reached the ears of ordinary hobbits.But even the deafest and most stay-at-home began to hear queertales; and those whose business took them to the borders saw strangethings. The conversation in The Green Dragon at Bywater, one eveningin the spring of Frodo’s fiftieth year, showed that even in the comfortable heart of the Shire rumours had been heard, though most hobbitsstill laughed at them.Sam Gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire, and oppositehim was Ted Sandyman, the miller’s son; and there were variousother rustic hobbits listening to their talk.‘Queer things you do hear these days, to be sure,’ said Sam.‘Ah,’ said Ted, ‘you do, if you listen. But I can hear fireside-talesand children’s stories at home, if I want to.’‘No doubt you can,’ retorted Sam, ‘and I daresay there’s moretruth in some of them than you reckon. Who invented the storiesanyway? Take dragons now.’‘No thank ’ee,’ said Ted, ‘I won’t. I heard tell of them when I was ayoungster, but there’s no call to believe in them now. There’s only oneDragon in Bywater, and that’s Green,’ he said, getting a general laugh.‘All right,’ said Sam, laughing with the rest. ‘But what about theseTree-men, these giants, as you might call them? They do say thatone bigger than a tree was seen up away beyond the North Moorsnot long back.’‘Who’s they?’‘My cousin Hal for one. He works for Mr. Boffin at Overhill andgoes up to the Northfarthing for the hunting. He saw one.’‘Says he did, perhaps. Your Hal’s always saying he’s seen things;and maybe he sees things that ain’t there.’‘But this one was as big as an elm tree, and walking – walkingseven yards to a stride, if it was an inch.’‘Then I bet it wasn’t an inch. What he saw was an elm tree, aslike as not.’T HE SHADOW O F TH E PAST 45‘But this one was walking, I tell you; and there ain’t no elm treeon the North Moors.’‘Then Hal can’t have seen one,’ said Ted. There was some laughing and clapping: the audience seemed to think that Ted had scoreda point.‘All the same,’ said Sam, ‘you can’t deny that others besides ourHalfast have seen queer folk crossing the Shire – crossing it, mindyou: there are more that are turned back at the borders. The Boundershave never been so busy before.‘And I’ve heard tell that Elves are moving west. They do say theyare going to the harbours, out away beyond the White Towers.’ Samwaved his arm vaguely: neither he nor any of them knew how far itwas to the Sea, past the old towers beyond the western borders ofthe Shire. But it was an old tradition that away over there stood theGrey Havens, from which at times elven-ships set sail, never to return.‘They are sailing, sailing, sailing over the Sea, they are going intothe West and leaving us,’ said Sam, half chanting the words, shakinghis head sadly and solemnly. But Ted laughed.‘Well, that isn’t anything new, if you believe the old tales. And Idon’t see what it matters to me or you. Let them sail! But I warrantyou haven’t seen them doing it; nor anyone else in the Shire.’‘Well, I don’t know,’ said Sam thoughtfully. He believed he hadonce seen an Elf in the woods, and still hoped to see more one day.Of all the legends that he had heard in his early years such fragmentsof tales and half-remembered stories about the Elves as the hobbitsknew, had always moved him most deeply. ‘There are some, even inthese parts, as know the Fair Folk and get news of them,’ he said.‘There’s Mr. Baggins now, that I work for. He told me that theywere sailing and he knows a bit about Elves. And old Mr. Bilbo knewmore: many’s the talk I had with him when I was a little lad.’‘Oh, they’re both cracked,’ said Ted. ‘Leastways old Bilbo wascracked, and Frodo’s cracking. If that’s where you get your newsfrom, you’ll never want for moonshine. Well, friends, I’m off home.Your good health!’ He drained his mug and went out noisily.Sam sat silent and said no more. He had a good deal to thinkabout. For one thing, there was a lot to do up in the Bag End garden,and he would have a busy day tomorrow, if the weather cleared. Thegrass was growing fast. But Sam had more on his mind than gardening. After a while he sighed, and got up and went out.It was early April and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain.The sun was down, and a cool pale evening was quietly fading intonight. He walked home under the early stars through Hobbiton andup the Hill, whistling softly and thoughtfully.* * *46 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSIt was just at this time that Gandalf reappeared after his longabsence. For three years after the Party he had been away. Then hepaid Frodo a brief visit, and after taking a good look at him he wentoff again. During the next year or two he had turned up fairly often,coming unexpectedly after dusk, and going off without warningbefore sunrise. He would not discuss his own business and journeys,and seemed chiefly interested in small news about Frodo’s healthand doings.Then suddenly his visits had ceased. It was over nine years sinceFrodo had seen or heard of him, and he had begun to think that thewizard would never return and had given up all interest in hobbits.But that evening, as Sam was walking home and twilight was fading,there came the once familiar tap on the study window.Frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight.They looked hard at one another.‘All well eh?’ said Gandalf. ‘You look the same as ever, Frodo!’‘So do you,’ Frodo replied; but secretly he thought that Gandalflooked older and more careworn. He pressed him for news of himselfand of the wide world, and soon they were deep in talk, and theystayed up far into the night.Next morning after a late breakfast, the wizard was sitting withFrodo by the open window of the study. A bright fire was on thehearth, but the sun was warm, and the wind was in the South. Everything looked fresh, and the new green of spring was shimmering inthe fields and on the tips of the trees’ fingers.Gandalf was thinking of a spring, nearly eighty years before, whenBilbo had run out of Bag End without a handkerchief. His hair wasperhaps whiter than it had been then, and his beard and eyebrowswere perhaps longer, and his face more lined with care and wisdom;but his eyes were as bright as ever, and he smoked and blew smokerings with the same vigour and delight.He was smoking now in silence, for Frodo was sitting still, deepin thought. Even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow ofthe tidings that Gandalf had brought. At last he broke the silence.‘Last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring,Gandalf,’ he said. ‘And then you stopped, because you said that suchmatters were best left until daylight. Don’t you think you had betterfinish now? You say the ring is dangerous, far more dangerous thanI guess. In what way?’‘In many ways,’ answered the wizard. ‘It is far more powerful thanI ever dared to think at first, so powerful that in the end it wouldutterly overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it. It wouldpossess him.T HE SHADOW O F TH E PAST 47‘In Eregion long ago many Elven-rings were made, magic rings asyou call them, and they were, of course, of various kinds: some morepotent and some less. The lesser rings were only essays in the craftbefore it was full-grown, and to the Elven-smiths they were but trifles– yet still to my mind dangerous for mortals. But the Great Rings,the Rings of Power, they were perilous.‘A mortal, Frodo, who keeps one of the Great Rings, does notdie, but he does not grow or obtain more life, he merely continues,until at last every minute is a weariness. And if he often uses theRing to make himself invisible, he fades: he becomes in the endinvisible permanently, and walks in the twilight under the eye of theDark Power that rules the Rings. Yes, sooner or later – later, if he isstrong or well-meaning to begin with, but neither strength nor goodpurpose will last – sooner or later the Dark Power will devour him.’‘How terrifying!’ said Frodo. There was another long silence. Thesound of Sam Gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden.‘How long have you known this?’ asked Frodo at length. ‘Andhow much did Bilbo know?’‘Bilbo knew no more than he told you, I am sure,’ said Gandalf.‘He would certainly never have passed on to you anything that hethought would be a danger, even though I promised to look afteryou. He thought the ring was very beautiful, and very useful at need;and if anything was wrong or queer, it was himself. He said that itwas ‘‘growing on his mind’’, and he was always worrying about it;but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to blame. Though hehad found out that the thing needed looking after; it did not seemalways of the same size or weight; it shrank or expanded in an oddway, and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tight.’‘Yes, he warned me of that in his last letter,’ said Frodo, ‘so Ihave always kept it on its chain.’‘Very wise,’ said Gandalf. ‘But as for his long life, Bilbo never connected it with the ring at all. He took all the credit for that to himself,and he was very proud of it. Though he was getting restless and uneasy.Thin and stretched he said. A sign that the ring was getting control.’‘How long have you known all this?’ asked Frodo again.‘Known?’ said Gandalf. ‘I have known much that only the Wiseknow, Frodo. But if you mean ‘‘known about this ring’’, well, I stilldo not know, one might say. There is a last test to make. But I nolonger doubt my guess.‘When did I first begin to guess?’ he mused, searching back inmemory. ‘Let me see – it was in the year that the White Councildrove the Dark Power from Mirkwood, just before the Battle of FiveArmies, that Bilbo found his ring. A shadow fell on my heart then,48 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSthough I did not know yet what I feared. I wondered often howGollum came by a Great Ring, as plainly it was – that at least wasclear from the first. Then I heard Bilbo’s strange story of how he had‘‘won’’ it, and I could not believe it. When I at last got the truth outof him, I saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to thering beyond doubt. Much like Gollum with his ‘‘birthday-present’’.The lies were too much alike for my comfort. Clearly the ring hadan unwholesome power that set to work on its keeper at once. Thatwas the first real warning I had that all was not well. I told Bilbooften that such rings were better left unused; but he resented it, andsoon got angry. There was little else that I could do. I could not takeit from him without doing greater harm; and I had no right to do soanyway. I could only watch and wait. I might perhaps have consultedSaruman the White, but something always held me back.’‘Who is he?’ asked Frodo. ‘I have never heard of him before.’‘Maybe not,’ answered Gandalf. ‘Hobbits are, or were, no concernof his. Yet he is great among the Wise. He is the chief of my orderand the head of the Council. His knowledge is deep, but his pridehas grown with it, and he takes ill any meddling. The lore of theElven-rings, great and small, is his province. He has long studied it,seeking the lost secrets of their making; but when the Rings weredebated in the Council, all that he would reveal to us of his ring-loretold against my fears. So my doubt slept – but uneasily. Still I watchedand I waited.‘And all seemed well with Bilbo. And the years passed. Yes, theypassed, and they seemed not to touch him. He showed no signs ofage. The shadow fell on me again. But I said to myself: ‘‘After all hecomes of a long-lived family on his mother’s side. There is time yet.Wait!’’‘And I waited. Until that night when he left this house. He saidand did things then that filled me with a fear that no words ofSaruman could allay. I knew at last that something dark and deadlywas at work. And I have spent most of the years since then in findingout the truth of it.’‘There wasn’t any permanent harm done, was there?’ asked Frodoanxiously. ‘He would get all right in time, wouldn’t he? Be able torest in peace, I mean?’‘He felt better at once,’ said Gandalf. ‘But there is only one Powerin this world that knows all about the Rings and their effects; and asfar as I know there is no Power in the world that knows all abouthobbits. Among the Wise I am the only one that goes in for hobbitlore: an obscure branch of knowledge, but full of surprises. Soft asbutter they can be, and yet sometimes as tough as old tree-roots. Ithink it likely that some would resist the Rings far longer than mostT HE SHADOW O F TH E PAST 49of the Wise would believe. I don’t think you need worry about Bilbo.‘Of course, he possessed the ring for many years, and used it, soit might take a long while for the influence to wear off – before itwas safe for him to see it again, for instance. Otherwise, he mightlive on for years, quite happily: just stop as he was when he partedwith it. For he gave it up in the end of his own accord: an importantpoint. No, I was not troubled about dear Bilbo any more, once hehad let the thing go. It is for you that I feel responsible.‘Ever since Bilbo left I have been deeply concerned about you,and about all these charming, absurd, helpless hobbits. It would bea grievous blow to the world, if the Dark Power overcame the Shire;if all your kind, jolly, stupid Bolgers, Hornblowers, Boffins, Bracegirdles, and the rest, not to mention the ridiculous Bagginses, becameenslaved.’Frodo shuddered. ‘But why should we be?’ he asked. ‘And whyshould he want such slaves?’‘To tell you the truth,’ replied Gandalf, ‘I believe that hitherto –hitherto, mark you – he has entirely overlooked the existence ofhobbits. You should be thankful. But your safety has passed. He doesnot need you – he has many more useful servants – but he won’tforget you again. And hobbits as miserable slaves would please himfar more than hobbits happy and free. There is such a thing as maliceand revenge.’‘Revenge?’ said Frodo. ‘Revenge for what? I still don’t understandwhat all this has to do with Bilbo and myself, and our ring.’‘It has everything to do with it,’ said Gandalf. ‘You do not knowthe real peril yet; but you shall. I was not sure of it myself when Iwas last here; but the time has come to speak. Give me the ring fora moment.’Frodo took it from his breeches-pocket, where it was clasped to achain that hung from his belt. He unfastened it and handed it slowlyto the wizard. It felt suddenly very heavy, as if either it or Frodohimself was in some way reluctant for Gandalf to touch it.Gandalf held it up. It looked to be made of pure and solid gold.‘Can you see any markings on it?’ he asked.‘No,’ said Frodo. ‘There are none. It is quite plain, and it nevershows a scratch or sign of wear.’‘Well then, look!’ To Frodo’s astonishment and distress the wizardthrew it suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner of the fire.Frodo gave a cry and groped for the tongs; but Gandalf held himback.‘Wait!’ he said in a commanding voice, giving Frodo a quick lookfrom under his bristling brows.50 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSNo apparent change came over the ring. After a while Gandalf gotup, closed the shutters outside the window, and drew the curtains.The room became dark and silent, though the clack of Sam’s shears,now nearer to the windows, could still be heard faintly from thegarden. For a moment the wizard stood looking at the fire; then hestooped and removed the ring to the hearth with the tongs, and atonce picked it up. Frodo gasped.‘It is quite cool,’ said Gandalf. ‘Take it!’ Frodo received it on hisshrinking palm: it seemed to have become thicker and heavier thanever.‘Hold it up!’ said Gandalf. ‘And look closely!’As Frodo did so, he now saw fine lines, finer than the finest penstrokes, running along the ring, outside and inside: lines of fire thatseemed to form the letters of a flowing script. They shone piercinglybright, and yet remote, as if out of a great depth.‘I cannot read the fiery letters,’ said Frodo in a quavering voice.‘No,’ said Gandalf, ‘but I can. The letters are Elvish, of an ancientmode, but the language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here.But this in the Common Tongue is what is said, close enough:One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.It is only two lines of a verse long known in Elven-lore:Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,One for the Dark Lord on his dark throneIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind themIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.’He paused, and then said slowly in a deep voice: ‘This is theMaster-ring, the One Ring to rule them all. This is the One RingT HE SHADOW O F TH E PAST 51that he lost many ages ago, to the great weakening of his power. Hegreatly desires it – but he must not get it.’Frodo sat silent and motionless. Fear seemed to stretch out a vasthand, like a dark cloud rising in the East and looming up to engulfhim. ‘This ring!’ he stammered. ‘How, how on earth did it come tome?’‘Ah!’ said Gandalf. ‘That is a very long story. The beginnings lieback in the Black Years, which only the lore-masters now remember.If I were to tell you all that tale, we should still be sitting here whenSpring had passed into Winter.‘But last night I told you of Sauron the Great, the Dark Lord.The rumours that you have heard are true: he has indeed arisen againand left his hold in Mirkwood and returned to his ancient fastnessin the Dark Tower of Mordor. That name even you hobbits haveheard of, like a shadow on the borders of old stories. Always after adefeat and a respite, the Shadow takes another shape and growsagain.’‘I wish it need not have happened in my time,’ said Frodo.‘So do I,’ said Gandalf, ‘and so do all who live to see such times.But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what todo with the time that is given us. And already, Frodo, our time isbeginning to look black. The Enemy is fast becoming very strong.His plans are far from ripe, I think, but they are ripening. We shallbe hard put to it. We should be very hard put to it, even if it werenot for this dreadful chance.‘The Enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to beat down all resistance, break the last defences, and coverall the lands in a second darkness. He lacks the One Ring.‘The Three, fairest of all, the Elf-lords hid from him, and hishand never touched them or sullied them. Seven the Dwarf-kingspossessed, but three he has recovered, and the others the dragonshave consumed. Nine he gave to Mortal Men, proud and great, andso ensnared them. Long ago they fell under the dominion of the One,and they became Ringwraiths, shadows under his great Shadow, hismost terrible servants. Long ago. It is many a year since the Ninewalked abroad. Yet who knows? As the Shadow grows once more,they too may walk again. But come! We will not speak of such thingseven in the morning of the Shire.‘So it is now: the Nine he has gathered to himself; the Seven also,or else they are destroyed. The Three are hidden still. But that nolonger troubles him. He only needs the One; for he made that Ringhimself, it is his, and he let a great part of his own former power passinto it, so that he could rule all the others. If he recovers it, then he52 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSwill command them all again, wherever they be, even the Three, andall that has been wrought with them will be laid bare, and he will bestronger than ever.‘And this is the dreadful chance, Frodo. He believed that the Onehad perished; that the Elves had destroyed it, as should have beendone. But he knows now that it has not perished, that it has beenfound. So he is seeking it, seeking it, and all his thought is bent onit. It is his great hope and our great fear.’‘Why, why wasn’t it destroyed?’ cried Frodo. ‘And how did theEnemy ever come to lose it, if he was so strong, and it was so preciousto him?’ He clutched the Ring in his hand, as if he saw already darkfingers stretching out to seize it.‘It was taken from him,’ said Gandalf. ‘The strength of the Elvesto resist him was greater long ago; and not all Men were estrangedfrom them. The Men of Westernesse came to their aid. That is achapter of ancient history which it might be good to recall; for therewas sorrow then too, and gathering dark, but great valour, and greatdeeds that were not wholly vain. One day, perhaps, I will tell you allthe tale, or you shall hear it told in full by one who knows it best.‘But for the moment, since most of all you need to know howthis thing came to you, and that will be tale enough, this is all thatI will say. It was Gil-galad, Elven-king and Elendil of Westernessewho overthrew Sauron, though they themselves perished in the deed;and Isildur Elendil’s son cut the Ring from Sauron’s hand and tookit for his own. Then Sauron was vanquished and his spirit fled andwas hidden for long years, until his shadow took shape again inMirkwood.‘But the Ring was lost. It fell into the Great River, Anduin, andvanished. For Isildur was marching north along the east banks of theRiver, and near the Gladden Fields he was waylaid by the Orcs ofthe Mountains, and almost all his folk were slain. He leaped into thewaters, but the Ring slipped from his finger as he swam, and thenthe Orcs saw him and killed him with arrows.’Gandalf paused. ‘And there in the dark pools amid the GladdenFields,’ he said, ‘the Ring passed out of knowledge and legend; andeven so much of its history is known now only to a few, and theCouncil of the Wise could discover no more. But at last I can carryon the story, I think.‘Long after, but still very long ago, there lived by the banks of theGreat River on the edge of Wilderland a clever-handed and quietfooted little people. I guess they were of hobbit-kind; akin to thefathers of the fathers of the Stoors, for they loved the River, and oftenswam in it, or made little boats of reeds. There was among them aT HE SHADOW O F TH E PAST 53family of high repute, for it was large and wealthier than most, andit was ruled by a grandmother of the folk, stern and wise in old lore,such as they had. The most inquisitive and curious-minded of thatfamily was called Sme´agol. He was interested in roots and beginnings;he dived into deep pools; he burrowed under trees and growingplants; he tunnelled into green mounds; and he ceased to look up atthe hill-tops, or the leaves on trees, or the flowers opening in the air:his head and his eyes were downward.‘He had a friend called De´agol, of similar sort, sharper-eyed butnot so quick and strong. On a time they took a boat and went downto the Gladden Fields, where there were great beds of iris and flowering reeds. There Sme´agol got out and went nosing about the banksbut De´agol sat in the boat and fished. Suddenly a great fish took hishook, and before he knew where he was, he was dragged out anddown into the water, to the bottom. Then he let go of his line, forhe thought he saw something shining in the river-bed; and holdinghis breath he grabbed at it.‘Then up he came spluttering, with weeds in his hair and a handfulof mud; and he swam to the bank. And behold! when he washed themud away, there in his hand lay a beautiful golden ring; and it shoneand glittered in the sun, so that his heart was glad. But Sme´agol hadbeen watching him from behind a tree, and as De´agol gloated overthe ring, Sme´agol came softly up behind.‘ ‘‘Give us that, De´agol, my love,’’ said Sme´agol, over his friend’sshoulder.‘ ‘‘Why?’’ said De´agol.‘ ‘‘Because it’s my birthday, my love, and I wants it,’’ said Sme´agol.‘ ‘‘I don’t care,’’ said De´agol. ‘‘I have given you a present already,more than I could afford. I found this, and I’m going to keep it.’’‘ ‘‘Oh, are you indeed, my love,’’ said Sme´agol; and he caughtDe´agol by the throat and strangled him, because the gold looked sobright and beautiful. Then he put the ring on his finger.‘No one ever found out what had become of De´agol; he wasmurdered far from home, and his body was cunningly hidden. ButSme´agol returned alone; and he found that none of his family couldsee him, when he was wearing the ring. He was very pleased withhis discovery and he concealed it; and he used it to find out secrets,and he put his knowledge to crooked and malicious uses. He becamesharp-eyed and keen-eared for all that was hurtful. The ring hadgiven him power according to his stature. It is not to be wonderedat that he became very unpopular and was shunned (when visible)by all his relations. They kicked him, and he bit their feet. He tookto thieving, and going about muttering to himself, and gurgling inhis throat. So they called him Gollum, and cursed him, and told him54 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSto go far away; and his grandmother, desiring peace, expelled himfrom the family and turned him out of her hole.‘He wandered in loneliness, weeping a little for the hardness ofthe world, and he journeyed up the River, till he came to a streamthat flowed down from the mountains, and he went that way. Hecaught fish in deep pools with invisible fingers and ate them raw.One day it was very hot, and as he was bending over a pool, he felta burning on the back of his head, and a dazzling light from the waterpained his wet eyes. He wondered at it, for he had almost forgottenabout the Sun. Then for the last time he looked up and shook hisfist at her.‘But as he lowered his eyes, he saw far ahead the tops of the MistyMountains, out of which the stream came. And he thought suddenly:‘‘It would be cool and shady under those mountains. The Sun couldnot watch me there. The roots of those mountains must be rootsindeed; there must be great secrets buried there which have not beendiscovered since the beginning.’’‘So he journeyed by night up into the highlands, and he found alittle cave out of which the dark stream ran; and he wormed his waylike a maggot into the heart of the hills, and vanished out of allknowledge. The Ring went into the shadows with him, and even themaker, when his power had begun to grow again, could learn nothingof it.’‘Gollum!’ cried Frodo. ‘Gollum? Do you mean that this is the veryGollum-creature that Bilbo met? How loathsome!’‘I think it is a sad story,’ said the wizard, ‘and it might havehappened to others, even to some hobbits that I have known.’‘I can’t believe that Gollum was connected with hobbits, howeverdistantly,’ said Frodo with some heat. ‘What an abominable notion!’‘It is true all the same,’ replied Gandalf. ‘About their origins, atany rate, I know more than hobbits do themselves. And even Bilbo’sstory suggests the kinship. There was a great deal in the backgroundof their minds and memories that was very similar. They understoodone another remarkably well, very much better than a hobbit wouldunderstand, say, a Dwarf, or an Orc, or even an Elf. Think of theriddles they both knew, for one thing.’‘Yes,’ said Frodo. ‘Though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles,and of much the same sort. And hobbits don’t cheat. Gollum meantto cheat all the time. He was just trying to put poor Bilbo off hisguard. And I daresay it amused his wickedness to start a game whichmight end in providing him with an easy victim, but if he lost wouldnot hurt him.’‘Only too true, I fear,’ said Gandalf. ‘But there was somethingT HE SHADOW O F TH E PAST 55else in it, I think, which you don’t see yet. Even Gollum was notwholly ruined. He had proved tougher than even one of the Wisewould have guessed – as a hobbit might. There was a little corner ofhis mind that was still his own, and light came through it, as througha chink in the dark: light out of the past. It was actually pleasant, Ithink, to hear a kindly voice again, bringing up memories of wind,and trees, and sun on the grass, and such forgotten things.‘But that, of course, would only make the evil part of him angrierin the end – unless it could be conquered. Unless it could be cured.’Gandalf sighed. ‘Alas! there is little hope of that for him. Yet not nohope. No, not though he possessed the Ring so long, almost as farback as he can remember. For it was long since he had worn it much:in the black darkness it was seldom needed. Certainly he had never‘‘faded’’. He is thin and tough still. But the thing was eating up hismind, of course, and the torment had become almost unbearable.‘All the ‘‘great secrets’’ under the mountains had turned out tobe just empty night: there was nothing more to find out, nothingworth doing, only nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering.He was altogether wretched. He hated the dark, and he hated lightmore: he hated everything, and the Ring most of all.’‘What do you mean?’ said Frodo. ‘Surely the Ring was his Preciousand the only thing he cared for? But if he hated it, why didn’t he getrid of it, or go away and leave it?’‘You ought to begin to understand, Frodo, after all you haveheard,’ said Gandalf. ‘He hated it and loved it, as he hated and lovedhimself. He could not get rid of it. He had no will left in the matter.‘A Ring of Power looks after itself, Frodo. It may slip off treacherously, but its keeper never abandons it. At most he plays with theidea of handing it on to someone else’s care – and that only at anearly stage, when it first begins to grip. But as far as I know Bilboalone in history has ever gone beyond playing, and really done it. Heneeded all my help, too. And even so he would never have justforsaken it, or cast it aside. It was not Gollum, Frodo, but the Ringitself that decided things. The Ring left him.’‘What, just in time to meet Bilbo?’ said Frodo. ‘Wouldn’t an Orchave suited it better?’‘It is no laughing matter,’ said Gandalf. ‘Not for you. It was thestrangest event in the whole history of the Ring so far: Bilbo’s arrivaljust at that time, and putting his hand on it, blindly, in the dark.‘There was more than one power at work, Frodo. The Ring wastrying to get back to its master. It had slipped from Isildur’s handand betrayed him; then when a chance came it caught poor De´agol,and he was murdered; and after that Gollum, and it had devouredhim. It could make no further use of him: he was too small and56 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSmean; and as long as it stayed with him he would never leave hisdeep pool again. So now, when its master was awake once more andsending out his dark thought from Mirkwood, it abandoned Gollum.Only to be picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable: Bilbofrom the Shire!‘Behind that there was something else at work, beyond any designof the Ring-maker. I can put it no plainer than by saying that Bilbowas meant to find the Ring, and not by its maker. In which case youalso were meant to have it. And that may be an encouraging thought.’‘It is not,’ said Frodo. ‘Though I am not sure that I understandyou. But how have you learned all this about the Ring, and aboutGollum? Do you really know it all, or are you just guessing still?’Gandalf looked at Frodo, and his eyes glinted. ‘I knew much andI have learned much,’ he answered. ‘But I am not going to give anaccount of all my doings to you. The history of Elendil and Isildurand the One Ring is known to all the Wise. Your ring is shown tobe that One Ring by the fire-writing alone, apart from any otherevidence.’‘And when did you discover that?’ asked Frodo, interrupting.‘Just now in this room, of course,’ answered the wizard sharply.‘But I expected to find it. I have come back from dark journeysand long search to make that final test. It is the last proof, and all isnow only too clear. Making out Gollum’s part, and fitting it into thegap in the history, required some thought. I may have started withguesses about Gollum, but I am not guessing now. I know. I haveseen him.’‘You have seen Gollum?’ exclaimed Frodo in amazement.‘Yes. The obvious thing to do, of course, if one could. I tried longago; but I have managed it at last.’‘Then what happened after Bilbo escaped from him? Do you knowthat?’‘Not so clearly. What I have told you is what Gollum was willingto tell – though not, of course, in the way I have reported it. Gollumis a liar, and you have to sift his words. For instance, he called theRing his ‘‘birthday-present’’, and he stuck to that. He said it camefrom his grandmother, who had lots of beautiful things of that kind.A ridiculous story. I have no doubt that Sme´agol’s grandmother wasa matriarch, a great person in her way, but to talk of her possessingmany Elven-rings was absurd, and as for giving them away, it was alie. But a lie with a grain of truth.‘The murder of De´agol haunted Gollum, and he had made up adefence, repeating it to his ‘‘Precious’’ over and over again, as hegnawed bones in the dark, until he almost believed it. It was hisbirthday. De´agol ought to have given the ring to him. It had obviouslyT HE SHADOW O F TH E PAST 57turned up just so as to be a present. It was his birthday-present, andso on, and on.‘I endured him as long as I could, but the truth was desperatelyimportant, and in the end I had to be harsh. I put the fear of fire onhim, and wrung the true story out of him, bit by bit, together withmuch snivelling and snarling. He thought he was misunderstood andill-used. But when he had at last told me his history, as far as theend of the Riddle-game and Bilbo’s escape, he would not say anymore, except in dark hints. Some other fear was on him greater thanmine. He muttered that he was going to get his own back. Peoplewould see if he would stand being kicked, and driven into a hole andthen robbed. Gollum had good friends now, good friends and verystrong. They would help him. Baggins would pay for it. That washis chief thought. He hated Bilbo and cursed his name. What is more,he knew where he came from.’‘But how did he find that out?’ asked Frodo.‘Well, as for the name, Bilbo very foolishly told Gollum himself;and after that it would not be difficult to discover his country, onceGollum came out. Oh yes, he came out. His longing for the Ringproved stronger than his fear of the Orcs, or even of the light. Aftera year or two he left the mountains. You see, though still bound bydesire of it, the Ring was no longer devouring him; he began to revivea little. He felt old, terribly old, yet less timid, and he was mortallyhungry.‘Light, light of Sun and Moon, he still feared and hated, and healways will, I think; but he was cunning. He found he could hidefrom daylight and moonshine, and make his way swiftly and softlyby dead of night with his pale cold eyes, and catch small frightenedor unwary things. He grew stronger and bolder with new food andnew air. He found his way into Mirkwood, as one would expect.’‘Is that where you found him?’ asked Frodo.‘I saw him there,’ answered Gandalf, ‘but before that he had wandered far, following Bilbo’s trail. It was difficult to learn anythingfrom him for certain, for his talk was constantly interrupted by cursesand threats. ‘‘What had it got in its pocketses?’’ he said. ‘‘It wouldn’tsay, no precious. Little cheat. Not a fair question. It cheated first, itdid. It broke the rules. We ought to have squeezed it, yes precious.And we will, precious!’’‘That is a sample of his talk. I don’t suppose you want any more.I had weary days of it. But from hints dropped among the snarlsI gathered that his padding feet had taken him at last to Esgaroth,and even to the streets of Dale, listening secretly and peering. Well,the news of the great events went far and wide in Wilderland, andmany had heard Bilbo’s name and knew where he came from. We58 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGShad made no secret of our return journey to his home in the West.Gollum’s sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted.’‘Then why didn’t he track Bilbo further?’ asked Frodo. ‘Why didn’the come to the Shire?’‘Ah,’ said Gandalf, ‘now we come to it. I think Gollum tried to.He set out and came back westward, as far as the Great River. Butthen he turned aside. He was not daunted by the distance, I am sure.No, something else drew him away. So my friends think, those thathunted him for me.‘The Wood-elves tracked him first, an easy task for them, for histrail was still fresh then. Through Mirkwood and back again it ledthem, though they never caught him. The wood was full of therumour of him, dreadful tales even among beasts and birds. TheWoodmen said that there was some new terror abroad, a ghost thatdrank blood. It climbed trees to find nests; it crept into holes to findthe young; it slipped through windows to find cradles.‘But at the western edge of Mirkwood the trail turned away. Itwandered off southwards and passed out of the Wood-elves’ ken,and was lost. And then I made a great mistake. Yes, Frodo, and notthe first; though I fear it may prove the worst. I let the matter be. Ilet him go; for I had much else to think of at that time, and I stilltrusted the lore of Saruman.‘Well, that was years ago. I have paid for it since with many darkand dangerous days. The trail was long cold when I took it up again,after Bilbo left here. And my search would have been in vain, butfor the help that I had from a friend: Aragorn, the greatest travellerand huntsman of this age of the world. Together we sought forGollum down the whole length of Wilderland, without hope, andwithout success. But at last, when I had given up the chase andturned to other paths, Gollum was found. My friend returned out ofgreat perils bringing the miserable creature with him.‘What he had been doing he would not say. He only wept andcalled us cruel, with many a gollum in his throat; and when we pressedhim he whined and cringed, and rubbed his long hands, licking hisfingers as if they pained him, as if he remembered some old torture.But I am afraid there is no possible doubt: he had made his slow,sneaking way, step by step, mile by mile, south, down at last to theLand of Mordor.’A heavy silence fell in the room. Frodo could hear his heart beating.Even outside everything seemed still. No sound of Sam’s shears couldnow be heard.‘Yes, to Mordor,’ said Gandalf. ‘Alas! Mordor draws all wickedthings, and the Dark Power was bending all its will to gather themT HE SHADOW O F TH E PAST 59there. The Ring of the Enemy would leave its mark, too, leave himopen to the summons. And all folk were whispering then of the newShadow in the South, and its hatred of the West. There were his finenew friends, who would help him in his revenge!‘Wretched fool! In that land he would learn much, too much forhis comfort. And sooner or later as he lurked and pried on the bordershe would be caught, and taken – for examination. That was the wayof it, I fear. When he was found he had already been there long, andwas on his way back. On some errand of mischief. But that does notmatter much now. His worst mischief was done.‘Yes, alas! through him the Enemy has learned that the One hasbeen found again. He knows where Isildur fell. He knows whereGollum found his ring. He knows that it is a Great Ring, for it gavelong life. He knows that it is not one of the Three, for they havenever been lost, and they endure no evil. He knows that it is not oneof the Seven, or the Nine, for they are accounted for. He knows thatit is the One. And he has at last heard, I think, of hobbits and theShire.‘The Shire – he may be seeking for it now, if he has not alreadyfound out where it lies. Indeed, Frodo, I fear that he may even thinkthat the long-unnoticed name of Baggins has become important.’‘But this is terrible!’ cried Frodo. ‘Far worse than the worst thatI imagined from your hints and warnings. O Gandalf, best of friends,what am I to do? For now I am really afraid. What am I to do? Whata pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!’‘Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not tostrike without need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be surethat he took so little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end,because he began his ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.’‘I am sorry,’ said Frodo. ‘But I am frightened; and I do not feelany pity for Gollum.’‘You have not seen him,’ Gandalf broke in.‘No, and I don’t want to,’ said Frodo. ‘I can’t understand you.Do you mean to say that you, and the Elves, have let him live onafter all those horrible deeds? Now at any rate he is as bad as an Orc,and just an enemy. He deserves death.’‘Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. Andsome that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not betoo eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wisecannot see all ends. I have not much hope that Gollum can be curedbefore he dies, but there is a chance of it. And he is bound up withthe fate of the Ring. My heart tells me that he has some part to playyet, for good or ill, before the end; and when that comes, the pity ofBilbo may rule the fate of many – yours not least. In any case we did60 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSnot kill him: he is very old and very wretched. The Wood-elves havehim in prison, but they treat him with such kindness as they can findin their wise hearts.’‘All the same,’ said Frodo, ‘even if Bilbo could not kill Gollum, Iwish he had not kept the Ring. I wish he had never found it, andthat I had not got it! Why did you let me keep it? Why didn’t youmake me throw it away, or, or destroy it?’‘Let you? Make you?’ said the wizard. ‘Haven’t you been listeningto all that I have said? You are not thinking of what you are saying.But as for throwing it away, that was obviously wrong. These Ringshave a way of being found. In evil hands it might have done greatevil. Worst of all, it might have fallen into the hands of the Enemy.Indeed it certainly would; for this is the One, and he is exerting allhis power to find it or draw it to himself.‘Of course, my dear Frodo, it was dangerous for you; and that hastroubled me deeply. But there was so much at stake that I had totake some risk – though even when I was far away there has neverbeen a day when the Shire has not been guarded by watchful eyes.As long as you never used it, I did not think that the Ring wouldhave any lasting effect on you, not for evil, not at any rate for a verylong time. And you must remember that nine years ago, when I lastsaw you, I still knew little for certain.’‘But why not destroy it, as you say should have been done longago?’ cried Frodo again. ‘If you had warned me, or even sent me amessage, I would have done away with it.’‘Would you? How would you do that? Have you ever tried?’‘No. But I suppose one could hammer it or melt it.’‘Try!’ said Gandalf. ‘Try now!’Frodo drew the Ring out of his pocket again and looked at it. Itnow appeared plain and smooth, without mark or device that hecould see. The gold looked very fair and pure, and Frodo thoughthow rich and beautiful was its colour, how perfect was its roundness.It was an admirable thing and altogether precious. When he took itout he had intended to fling it from him into the very hottest part ofthe fire. But he found now that he could not do so, not without agreat struggle. He weighed the Ring in his hand, hesitating, andforcing himself to remember all that Gandalf had told him; and thenwith an effort of will he made a movement, as if to cast it away –but he found that he had put it back in his pocket.Gandalf laughed grimly. ‘You see? Already you too, Frodo, cannoteasily let it go, nor will to damage it. And I could not ‘‘make’’ you– except by force, which would break your mind. But as for breakingthe Ring, force is useless. Even if you took it and struck it with aT HE SHADOW O F TH E PAST 61heavy sledge-hammer, it would make no dint in it. It cannot beunmade by your hands, or by mine.‘Your small fire, of course, would not melt even ordinary gold. ThisRing has already passed through it unscathed, and even unheated. Butthere is no smith’s forge in this Shire that could change it at all. Noteven the anvils and furnaces of the Dwarves could do that. It hasbeen said that dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings ofPower, but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which theold fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not evenAncalagon the Black, who could have harmed the One Ring, theRuling Ring, for that was made by Sauron himself.‘There is only one way: to find the Cracks of Doom in the depthsof Orodruin, the Fire-mountain, and cast the Ring in there, if youreally wish to destroy it, to put it beyond the grasp of the Enemy forever.’‘I do really wish to destroy it!’ cried Frodo. ‘Or, well, to have itdestroyed. I am not made for perilous quests. I wish I had never seenthe Ring! Why did it come to me? Why was I chosen?’‘Such questions cannot be answered,’ said Gandalf. ‘You may besure that it was not for any merit that others do not possess: not forpower or wisdom, at any rate. But you have been chosen, and youmust therefore use such strength and heart and wits as you have.’‘But I have so little of any of these things! You are wise andpowerful. Will you not take the Ring?’‘No!’ cried Gandalf, springing to his feet. ‘With that power I shouldhave power too great and terrible. And over me the Ring would gaina power still greater and more deadly.’ His eyes flashed and his facewas lit as by a fire within. ‘Do not tempt me! For I do not wish tobecome like the Dark Lord himself. Yet the way of the Ring to myheart is by pity, pity for weakness and the desire of strength to dogood. Do not tempt me! I dare not take it, not even to keep it safe,unused. The wish to wield it would be too great for my strength. Ishall have such need of it. Great perils lie before me.’He went to the window and drew aside the curtains and the shutters. Sunlight streamed back again into the room. Sam passed alongthe path outside whistling. ‘And now,’ said the wizard, turning backto Frodo, ‘the decision lies with you. But I will always help you.’ Helaid his hand on Frodo’s shoulder. ‘I will help you bear this burden,as long as it is yours to bear. But we must do something, soon. TheEnemy is moving.’There was a long silence. Gandalf sat down again and puffed athis pipe, as if lost in thought. His eyes seemed closed, but under thelids he was watching Frodo intently. Frodo gazed fixedly at the red62 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSembers on the hearth, until they filled all his vision, and he seemedto be looking down into profound wells of fire. He was thinking ofthe fabled Cracks of Doom and the terror of the Fiery Mountain.‘Well!’ said Gandalf at last. ‘What are you thinking about? Haveyou decided what to do?’‘No!’ answered Frodo, coming back to himself out of darkness,and finding to his surprise that it was not dark, and that out of thewindow he could see the sunlit garden. ‘Or perhaps, yes. As far as Iunderstand what you have said, I suppose I must keep the Ring andguard it, at least for the present, whatever it may do to me.’‘Whatever it may do, it will be slow, slow to evil, if you keep itwith that purpose,’ said Gandalf.‘I hope so,’ said Frodo. ‘But I hope that you may find some otherbetter keeper soon. But in the meanwhile it seems that I am a danger,a danger to all that live near me. I cannot keep the Ring and stayhere. I ought to leave Bag End, leave the Shire, leave everything andgo away.’ He sighed.‘I should like to save the Shire, if I could – though there have beentimes when I thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words,and have felt that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might begood for them. But I don’t feel like that now. I feel that as long asthe Shire lies behind, safe and comfortable, I shall find wanderingmore bearable: I shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold,even if my feet cannot stand there again.‘Of course, I have sometimes thought of going away, but I imagined that as a kind of holiday, a series of adventures like Bilbo’s orbetter, ending in peace. But this would mean exile, a flight fromdanger into danger, drawing it after me. And I suppose I must goalone, if I am to do that and save the Shire. But I feel very small,and very uprooted, and well – desperate. The Enemy is so strongand terrible.’He did not tell Gandalf, but as he was speaking a great desire tofollow Bilbo flamed up in his heart – to follow Bilbo, and even perhapsto find him again. It was so strong that it overcame his fear: he couldalmost have run out there and then down the road without his hat,as Bilbo had done on a similar morning long ago.‘My dear Frodo!’ exclaimed Gandalf. ‘Hobbits really are amazingcreatures, as I have said before. You can learn all that there is toknow about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred yearsthey can still surprise you at a pinch. I hardly expected to get suchan answer, not even from you. But Bilbo made no mistake in choosinghis heir, though he little thought how important it would prove. Iam afraid you are right. The Ring will not be able to stay hidden inthe Shire much longer; and for your own sake, as well as for others,T HE SHADOW O F TH E PAST 63you will have to go, and leave the name of Baggins behind you. Thatname will not be safe to have, outside the Shire or in the Wild. I willgive you a travelling name now. When you go, go as Mr. Underhill.‘But I don’t think you need go alone. Not if you know of anyoneyou can trust, and who would be willing to go by your side – andthat you would be willing to take into unknown perils. But if youlook for a companion, be careful in choosing! And be careful of whatyou say, even to your closest friends! The enemy has many spies andmany ways of hearing.’Suddenly he stopped as if listening. Frodo became aware that allwas very quiet, inside and outside. Gandalf crept to one side of thewindow. Then with a dart he sprang to the sill, and thrust a longarm out and downwards. There was a squawk, and up came SamGamgee’s curly head hauled by one ear.‘Well, well, bless my beard!’ said Gandalf. ‘Sam Gamgee is it?Now what may you be doing?’‘Lor bless you, Mr. Gandalf, sir!’ said Sam. ‘Nothing! LeastwaysI was just trimming the grass-border under the window, if you followme.’ He picked up his shears and exhibited them as evidence.‘I don’t,’ said Gandalf grimly. ‘It is some time since I last heardthe sound of your shears. How long have you been eavesdropping?’‘Eavesdropping, sir? I don’t follow you, begging your pardon.There ain’t no eaves at Bag End, and that’s a fact.’‘Don’t be a fool! What have you heard, and why did you listen?’Gandalf’s eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bristles.‘Mr. Frodo, sir!’ cried Sam quaking. ‘Don’t let him hurt me, sir!Don’t let him turn me into anything unnatural! My old dad wouldtake on so. I meant no harm, on my honour, sir!’‘He won’t hurt you,’ said Frodo, hardly able to keep from laughing,although he was himself startled and rather puzzled. ‘He knows, aswell as I do, that you mean no harm. But just you up and answerhis questions straight away!’‘Well, sir,’ said Sam dithering a little. ‘I heard a deal that I didn’trightly understand, about an enemy, and rings, and Mr. Bilbo, sir,and dragons, and a fiery mountain, and – and Elves, sir. I listenedbecause I couldn’t help myself, if you know what I mean. Lor blessme, sir, but I do love tales of that sort. And I believe them too,whatever Ted may say. Elves, sir! I would dearly love to see them.Couldn’t you take me to see Elves, sir, when you go?’Suddenly Gandalf laughed. ‘Come inside!’ he shouted, and puttingout both his arms he lifted the astonished Sam, shears, grass-clippingsand all, right through the window and stood him on the floor. ‘Takeyou to see Elves, eh?’ he said, eyeing Sam closely, but with a smileflickering on his face. ‘So you heard that Mr. Frodo is going away?’64 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGS‘I did, sir. And that’s why I choked: which you heard seemingly.I tried not to, sir, but it burst out of me: I was so upset.’‘It can’t be helped, Sam,’ said Frodo sadly. He had suddenlyrealized that flying from the Shire would mean more painful partingsthan merely saying farewell to the familiar comforts of Bag End. ‘Ishall have to go. But’ – and here he looked hard at Sam – ‘if youreally care about me, you will keep that dead secret. See? If you don’t,if you even breathe a word of what you’ve heard here, then I hopeGandalf will turn you into a spotted toad and fill the garden full ofgrass-snakes.’Sam fell on his knees, trembling. ‘Get up, Sam!’ said Gandalf. ‘Ihave thought of something better than that. Something to shut yourmouth, and punish you properly for listening. You shall go away withMr. Frodo!’‘Me, sir!’ cried Sam, springing up like a dog invited for a walk.‘Me go and see Elves and all! Hooray!’ he shouted, and then burstinto tears.Chapter 3THREE I S COMPANY‘You ought to go quietly, and you ought to go soon,’ said Gandalf.Two or three weeks had passed, and still Frodo made no sign ofgetting ready to go.‘I know. But it is difficult to do both,’ he objected. ‘If I just vanishlike Bilbo, the tale will be all over the Shire in no time.’‘Of course you mustn’t vanish!’ said Gandalf. ‘That wouldn’t doat all! I said soon, not instantly. If you can think of any way of slippingout of the Shire without its being generally known, it will be wortha little delay. But you must not delay too long.’‘What about the autumn, on or after Our Birthday?’ asked Frodo.‘I think I could probably make some arrangements by then.’To tell the truth, he was very reluctant to start, now that it hadcome to the point: Bag End seemed a more desirable residence thanit had for years, and he wanted to savour as much as he could of hislast summer in the Shire. When autumn came, he knew that part atleast of his heart would think more kindly of journeying, as it alwaysdid at that season. He had indeed privately made up his mind toleave on his fiftieth birthday: Bilbo’s one hundred and twenty-eighth.It seemed somehow the proper day on which to set out and followhim. Following Bilbo was uppermost in his mind, and the one thingthat made the thought of leaving bearable. He thought as little aspossible about the Ring, and where it might lead him in the end. Buthe did not tell all his thoughts to Gandalf. What the wizard guessedwas always difficult to tell.He looked at Frodo and smiled. ‘Very well,’ he said. ‘I think thatwill do – but it must not be any later. I am getting very anxious. Inthe meanwhile, do take care, and don’t let out any hint of where youare going! And see that Sam Gamgee does not talk. If he does, Ireally shall turn him into a toad.’‘As for where I am going,’ said Frodo, ‘it would be difficult to givethat away, for I have no clear idea myself, yet.’‘Don’t be absurd!’ said Gandalf. ‘I am not warning you againstleaving an address at the post-office! But you are leaving the Shire –and that should not be known, until you are far away. And you mustgo, or at least set out, either North, South, West or East – and thedirection should certainly not be known.’‘I have been so taken up with the thoughts of leaving Bag End, andof saying farewell, that I have never even considered the direction,’66 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSsaid Frodo. ‘For where am I to go? And by what shall I steer? Whatis to be my quest? Bilbo went to find a treasure, there and back again;but I go to lose one, and not return, as far as I can see.’‘But you cannot see very far,’ said Gandalf. ‘Neither can I. It maybe your task to find the Cracks of Doom; but that quest may be forothers: I do not know. At any rate you are not ready for that longroad yet.’‘No indeed!’ said Frodo. ‘But in the meantime what course am Ito take?’‘Towards danger; but not too rashly, nor too straight,’ answeredthe wizard. ‘If you want my advice, make for Rivendell. That journeyshould not prove too perilous, though the Road is less easy than itwas, and it will grow worse as the year fails.’‘Rivendell!’ said Frodo. ‘Very good: I will go east, and I will makefor Rivendell. I will take Sam to visit the Elves; he will be delighted.’He spoke lightly; but his heart was moved suddenly with a desire tosee the house of Elrond Halfelven, and breathe the air of that deepvalley where many of the Fair Folk still dwelt in peace.One summer’s evening an astonishing piece of news reached theIvy Bush and Green Dragon. Giants and other portents on the bordersof the Shire were forgotten for more important matters: Mr. Frodowas selling Bag End, indeed he had already sold it – to the SackvilleBagginses!‘For a nice bit, too,’ said some. ‘At a bargain price,’ said others,‘and that’s more likely when Mistress Lobelia’s the buyer.’ (Othohad died some years before, at the ripe but disappointed age of 102.)Just why Mr. Frodo was selling his beautiful hole was even moredebatable than the price. A few held the theory – supported by thenods and hints of Mr. Baggins himself – that Frodo’s money wasrunning out: he was going to leave Hobbiton and live in a quiet wayon the proceeds of the sale down in Buckland among his Brandybuckrelations. ‘As far from the Sackville-Bagginses as may be,’ someadded. But so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable wealthof the Bagginses of Bag End become that most found this hard tobelieve, harder than any other reason or unreason that their fancycould suggest: to most it suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plotby Gandalf. Though he kept himself very quiet and did not go aboutby day, it was well known that he was ‘hiding up in the Bag End’.But however a removal might fit in with the designs of his wizardry,there was no doubt about the fact: Frodo Baggins was going back toBuckland.‘Yes, I shall be moving this autumn,’ he said. ‘Merry Brandybuckis looking out for a nice little hole for me, or perhaps a small house.’T HR EE IS C OMPAN Y 67As a matter of fact with Merry’s help he had already chosenand bought a little house at Crickhollow in the country beyondBucklebury. To all but Sam he pretended he was going to settle downthere permanently. The decision to set out eastwards had suggestedthe idea to him; for Buckland was on the eastern borders of the Shire,and as he had lived there in childhood his going back would at leastseem credible.Gandalf stayed in the Shire for over two months. Then oneevening, at the end of June, soon after Frodo’s plan had been finallyarranged, he suddenly announced that he was going off again nextmorning. ‘Only for a short while, I hope,’ he said. ‘But I am goingdown beyond the southern borders to get some news, if I can. I havebeen idle longer than I should.’He spoke lightly, but it seemed to Frodo that he looked ratherworried. ‘Has anything happened?’ he asked.‘Well no; but I have heard something that has made me anxiousand needs looking into. If I think it necessary after all for you to getoff at once, I shall come back immediately, or at least send word. Inthe meanwhile stick to your plan; but be more careful than ever,especially of the Ring. Let me impress on you once more: don’t useit!’He went off at dawn. ‘I may be back any day,’ he said. ‘At thevery latest I shall come back for the farewell party. I think after allyou may need my company on the Road.’At first Frodo was a good deal disturbed, and wondered oftenwhat Gandalf could have heard; but his uneasiness wore off, and inthe fine weather he forgot his troubles for a while. The Shire hadseldom seen so fair a summer, or so rich an autumn: the trees wereladen with apples, honey was dripping in the combs, and the cornwas tall and full.Autumn was well under way before Frodo began to worry aboutGandalf again. September was passing and there was still no newsof him. The Birthday, and the removal, drew nearer, and still he didnot come, or send word. Bag End began to be busy. Some of Frodo’sfriends came to stay and help him with the packing: there wasFredegar Bolger and Folco Boffin, and of course his special friendsPippin Took and Merry Brandybuck. Between them they turned thewhole place upside-down.On September 20th two covered carts went off laden to Buckland,conveying the furniture and goods that Frodo had not sold to hisnew home, by way of the Brandywine Bridge.The next day Frodobecame really anxious, and kept a constant look-out for Gandalf.Thursday, his birthday morning, dawned as fair and clear as it had68 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSlong ago for Bilbo’s great party. Still Gandalf did not appear. In theevening Frodo gave his farewell feast: it was quite small, just a dinnerfor himself and his four helpers; but he was troubled and felt in nomood for it. The thought that he would so soon have to part withhis young friends weighed on his heart. He wondered how he wouldbreak it to them.The four younger hobbits were, however, in high spirits, and theparty soon became very cheerful in spite of Gandalf’s absence. Thedining-room was bare except for a table and chairs, but the food wasgood, and there was good wine: Frodo’s wine had not been includedin the sale to the Sackville-Bagginses.‘Whatever happens to the rest of my stuff, when the S.-B.s gettheir claws on it, at any rate I have found a good home for this!’ saidFrodo, as he drained his glass. It was the last drop of Old Winyards.When they had sung many songs, and talked of many thingsthey had done together, they toasted Bilbo’s birthday, and theydrank his health and Frodo’s together according to Frodo’s custom.Then they went out for a sniff of air, and glimpse of the stars, andthen they went to bed. Frodo’s party was over, and Gandalf had notcome.The next morning they were busy packing another cart with theremainder of the luggage. Merry took charge of this, and drove offwith Fatty (that is Fredegar Bolger). ‘Someone must get there andwarm the house before you arrive,’ said Merry. ‘Well, see you later– the day after tomorrow, if you don’t go to sleep on the way!’Folco went home after lunch, but Pippin remained behind. Frodowas restless and anxious, listening in vain for a sound of Gandalf.He decided to wait until nightfall. After that, if Gandalf wanted himurgently, he would go to Crickhollow, and might even get there first.For Frodo was going on foot. His plan – for pleasure and a last lookat the Shire as much as any other reason – was to walk from Hobbitonto Bucklebury Ferry, taking it fairly easy.‘I shall get myself a bit into training, too,’ he said, looking athimself in a dusty mirror in the half-empty hall. He had not doneany strenuous walking for a long time, and the reflection lookedrather flabby, he thought.After lunch, the Sackville-Bagginses, Lobelia and her sandy-hairedson, Lotho, turned up, much to Frodo’s annoyance. ‘Ours at last!’said Lobelia, as she stepped inside. It was not polite; nor strictly true,for the sale of Bag End did not take effect until midnight. But Lobeliacan perhaps be forgiven: she had been obliged to wait about seventyseven years longer for Bag End than she once hoped, and she wasnow a hundred years old. Anyway, she had come to see that nothingT HR EE IS C OMPAN Y 69she had paid for had been carried off; and she wanted the keys. Ittook a long while to satisfy her, as she had brought a complete inventory with her and went right through it. In the end she departed withLotho and the spare key and the promise that the other key wouldbe left at the Gamgees’ in Bagshot Row. She snorted, and showedplainly that she thought the Gamgees capable of plundering the holeduring the night. Frodo did not offer her any tea.He took his own tea with Pippin and Sam Gamgee in the kitchen.It had been officially announced that Sam was coming to Buckland‘to do for Mr. Frodo and look after his bit of garden’; an arrangementthat was approved by the Gaffer, though it did not console him forthe prospect of having Lobelia as a neighbour.‘Our last meal at Bag End!’ said Frodo, pushing back his chair.They left the washing up for Lobelia. Pippin and Sam strapped uptheir three packs and piled them in the porch. Pippin went out fora last stroll in the garden. Sam disappeared.The sun went down. Bag End seemed sad and gloomy and dishevelled. Frodo wandered round the familiar rooms, and saw the lightof the sunset fade on the walls, and shadows creep out of the corners.It grew slowly dark indoors. He went out and walked down to thegate at the bottom of the path, and then on a short way down theHill Road. He half expected to see Gandalf come striding up throughthe dusk.The sky was clear and the stars were growing bright. ‘It’s goingto be a fine night,’ he said aloud. ‘That’s good for a beginning. I feellike walking. I can’t bear any more hanging about. I am going tostart, and Gandalf must follow me.’ He turned to go back, and thenstopped, for he heard voices, just round the corner by the end ofBagshot Row. One voice was certainly the old Gaffer’s; the other wasstrange, and somehow unpleasant. He could not make out what itsaid, but he heard the Gaffer’s answers, which were rather shrill. Theold man seemed put out.‘No, Mr. Baggins has gone away. Went this morning, and my Samwent with him: anyway all his stuff went. Yes, sold out and gone, Itell’ee. Why? Why’s none of my business, or yours. Where to? Thatain’t no secret. He’s moved to Bucklebury or some such place, awaydown yonder. Yes it is – a tidy way. I’ve never been so far myself;they’re queer folks in Buckland. No, I can’t give no message. Goodnight to you!’Footsteps went away down the Hill. Frodo wondered vaguely whythe fact that they did not come on up the Hill seemed a great relief.‘I am sick of questions and curiosity about my doings, I suppose,’he thought. ‘What an inquisitive lot they all are!’ He had half a mind70 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSto go and ask the Gaffer who the inquirer was; but he thought better(or worse) of it, and turned and walked quickly back to Bag End.Pippin was sitting on his pack in the porch. Sam was not there.Frodo stepped inside the dark door. ‘Sam!’ he called. ‘Sam! Time!’‘Coming, sir!’ came the answer from far within, followed soon bySam himself, wiping his mouth. He had been saying farewell to thebeer-barrel in the cellar.‘All aboard, Sam?’ said Frodo.‘Yes, sir. I’ll last for a bit now, sir.’Frodo shut and locked the round door, and gave the key to Sam.‘Run down with this to your home, Sam!’ he said. ‘Then cut alongthe Row and meet us as quick as you can at the gate in the lanebeyond the meadows. We are not going through the village tonight.Too many ears pricking and eyes prying.’ Sam ran off at full speed.‘Well, now we’re off at last!’ said Frodo. They shouldered theirpacks and took up their sticks, and walked round the corner to thewest side of Bag End. ‘Good-bye!’ said Frodo, looking at the darkblank windows. He waved his hand, and then turned and (followingBilbo, if he had known it) hurried after Peregrin down the gardenpath. They jumped over the low place in the hedge at the bottomand took to the fields, passing into the darkness like a rustle in thegrasses.At the bottom of the Hill on its western side they came to the gateopening on to a narrow lane. There they halted and adjusted thestraps of their packs. Presently Sam appeared, trotting quickly andbreathing hard; his heavy pack was hoisted high on his shoulders,and he had put on his head a tall shapeless felt bag, which he calleda hat. In the gloom he looked very much like a dwarf.‘I am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff,’ said Frodo.‘I pity snails, and all that carry their homes on their backs.’‘I could take a lot more yet, sir. My packet is quite light,’ saidSam stoutly and untruthfully.‘No you don’t, Sam!’ said Pippin. ‘It is good for him. He’s gotnothing except what he ordered us to pack. He’s been slack lately,and he’ll feel the weight less when he’s walked off some of his own.’‘Be kind to a poor old hobbit!’ laughed Frodo. ‘I shall be as thinas a willow-wand, I’m sure, before I get to Buckland. But I wastalking nonsense. I suspect you have taken more than your share,Sam, and I shall look into it at our next packing.’ He picked up hisstick again. ‘Well, we all like walking in the dark,’ he said, ‘so let’sput some miles behind us before bed.’For a short way they followed the lane westwards. Then leavingit they turned left and took quietly to the fields again. They went inT HR EE IS C OMPAN Y 71single file along hedgerows and the borders of coppices, and nightfell dark about them. In their dark cloaks they were as invisible as ifthey all had magic rings. Since they were all hobbits, and were tryingto be silent, they made no noise that even hobbits would hear. Eventhe wild things in the fields and woods hardly noticed their passing.After some time they crossed the Water, west of Hobbiton, by anarrow plank-bridge. The stream was there no more than a windingblack ribbon, bordered with leaning alder-trees. A mile or two furthersouth they hastily crossed the great road from the Brandywine Bridge;they were now in the Tookland and bending south-eastwards theymade for the Green Hill Country. As they began to climb its firstslopes they looked back and saw the lamps in Hobbiton far off twinkling in the gentle valley of the Water. Soon it disappeared in the foldsof the darkened land, and was followed by Bywater beside its greypool. When the light of the last farm was far behind, peeping amongthe trees, Frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell.‘I wonder if I shall ever look down into that valley again,’ he saidquietly.When they had walked for about three hours they rested. Thenight was clear, cool, and starry, but smoke-like wisps of mist werecreeping up the hill-sides from the streams and deep meadows. Thinclad birches, swaying in a light wind above their heads, made a blacknet against the pale sky. They ate a very frugal supper (for hobbits),and then went on again. Soon they struck a narrow road, that wentrolling up and down, fading grey into the darkness ahead: the roadto Woodhall, and Stock, and the Bucklebury Ferry. It climbed awayfrom the main road in the Water-valley, and wound over the skirtsof the Green Hills towards Woody End, a wild corner of theEastfarthing.After a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track between talltrees that rustled their dry leaves in the night. It was very dark. Atfirst they talked, or hummed a tune softly together, being now faraway from inquisitive ears. Then they marched on in silence, andPippin began to lag behind. At last, as they began to climb a steepslope, he stopped and yawned.‘I am so sleepy,’ he said, ‘that soon I shall fall down on the road.Are you going to sleep on your legs? It is nearly midnight.’‘I thought you liked walking in the dark,’ said Frodo. ‘But thereis no great hurry. Merry expects us some time the day after tomorrow;but that leaves us nearly two days more. We’ll halt at the first likelyspot.’‘The wind’s in the West,’ said Sam. ‘If we get to the other sideof this hill, we shall find a spot that is sheltered and snug enough,sir. There is a dry fir-wood just ahead, if I remember rightly.’ Sam72 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSknew the land well within twenty miles of Hobbiton, but that wasthe limit of his geography.Just over the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir-wood.Leaving the road they went into the deep resin-scented darkness ofthe trees, and gathered dead sticks and cones to make a fire. Soonthey had a merry crackle of flame at the foot of a large fir-tree andthey sat round it for a while, until they began to nod. Then, each inan angle of the great tree’s roots, they curled up in their cloaks andblankets, and were soon fast asleep. They set no watch; even Frodofeared no danger yet, for they were still in the heart of the Shire. Afew creatures came and looked at them when the fire had died away.A fox passing through the wood on business of his own stoppedseveral minutes and sniffed.‘Hobbits!’ he thought. ‘Well, what next? I have heard of strangedoings in this land, but I have seldom heard of a hobbit sleeping outof doors under a tree. Three of them! There’s something mightyqueer behind this.’ He was quite right, but he never found out anymore about it.The morning came, pale and clammy. Frodo woke up first, andfound that a tree-root had made a hole in his back, and that his neckwas stiff. ‘Walking for pleasure! Why didn’t I drive?’ he thought, ashe usually did at the beginning of an expedition. ‘And all my beautifulfeather beds are sold to the Sackville-Bagginses! These tree-rootswould do them good.’ He stretched. ‘Wake up, hobbits!’ he cried.‘It’s a beautiful morning.’‘What’s beautiful about it?’ said Pippin, peering over the edge ofhis blanket with one eye. ‘Sam! Get breakfast ready for half-past nine!Have you got the bath-water hot?’Sam jumped up, looking rather bleary. ‘No, sir, I haven’t, sir!’ hesaid.Frodo stripped the blankets from Pippin and rolled him over, andthen walked off to the edge of the wood. Away eastward the sun wasrising red out of the mists that lay thick on the world. Touched withgold and red the autumn trees seemed to be sailing rootless in ashadowy sea. A little below him to the left the road ran down steeplyinto a hollow and disappeared.When he returned Sam and Pippin had got a good fire going.‘Water!’ shouted Pippin. ‘Where’s the water?’‘I don’t keep water in my pockets,’ said Frodo.‘We thought you had gone to find some,’ said Pippin, busy settingout the food, and cups. ‘You had better go now.’‘You can come too,’ said Frodo, ‘and bring all the water-bottles.’There was a stream at the foot of the hill. They filled their bottlesT HR EE IS C OMPAN Y 73and the small camping kettle at a little fall where the water fell a fewfeet over an outcrop of grey stone. It was icy cold; and they splutteredand puffed as they bathed their faces and hands.When their breakfast was over, and their packs all trussed up again,it was after ten o’clock, and the day was beginning to turn fine andhot. They went down the slope, and across the stream where it divedunder the road, and up the next slope, and up and down anothershoulder of the hills; and by that time their cloaks, blankets, water,food, and other gear already seemed a heavy burden.The day’s march promised to be warm and tiring work. After somemiles, however, the road ceased to roll up and down: it climbed tothe top of a steep bank in a weary zig-zagging sort of way, and thenprepared to go down for the last time. In front of them they saw thelower lands dotted with small clumps of trees that melted away inthe distance to a brown woodland haze. They were looking acrossthe Woody End towards the Brandywine River. The road woundaway before them like a piece of string.‘The road goes on for ever,’ said Pippin; ‘but I can’t without arest. It is high time for lunch.’ He sat down on the bank at the sideof the road and looked away east into the haze, beyond which laythe River, and the end of the Shire in which he had spent all his life.Sam stood by him. His round eyes were wide open – for he waslooking across lands he had never seen to a new horizon.‘Do Elves live in those woods?’ he asked.‘Not that I ever heard,’ said Pippin. Frodo was silent. He too wasgazing eastward along the road, as if he had never seen it before.Suddenly he spoke, aloud but as if to himself, saying slowly:The Road goes ever on and onDown from the door where it began.Now far ahead the Road has gone,And I must follow, if I can,Pursuing it with weary feet,Until it joins some larger way,Where many paths and errands meet.And whither then? I cannot say.‘That sounds like a bit of old Bilbo’s rhyming,’ said Pippin. ‘Oris it one of your imitations? It does not sound altogether encouraging.’‘I don’t know,’ said Frodo. ‘It came to me then, as if I was makingit up; but I may have heard it long ago. Certainly it reminds me verymuch of Bilbo in the last years, before he went away. He used oftento say there was only one Road; that it was like a great river: its74 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSsprings were at every doorstep, and every path was its tributary. ‘‘It’sa dangerous business, Frodo, going out of your door,’’ he used tosay. ‘‘You step into the Road, and if you don’t keep your feet, thereis no knowing where you might be swept off to. Do you realize thatthis is the very path that goes through Mirkwood, and that if you letit, it might take you to the Lonely Mountain or even further and toworse places?’’ He used to say that on the path outside the front doorat Bag End, especially after he had been out for a long walk.’‘Well, the Road won’t sweep me anywhere for an hour at least,’said Pippin, unslinging his pack. The others followed his example,putting their packs against the bank and their legs out into the road.After a rest they had a good lunch, and then more rest.The sun was beginning to get low and the light of afternoon wason the land as they went down the hill. So far they had not met asoul on the road. This way was not much used, being hardly fit forcarts, and there was little traffic to the Woody End. They had beenjogging along again for an hour or more when Sam stopped a momentas if listening. They were now on level ground, and the road aftermuch winding lay straight ahead through grass-land sprinkled withtall trees, outliers of the approaching woods.‘I can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind,’ saidSam.They looked back, but the turn of the road prevented them fromseeing far. ‘I wonder if that is Gandalf coming after us,’ said Frodo;but even as he said it, he had a feeling that it was not so, and asudden desire to hide from the view of the rider came over him.‘It may not matter much,’ he said apologetically, ‘but I wouldrather not be seen on the road – by anyone. I am sick of my doingsbeing noticed and discussed. And if it is Gandalf,’ he added as anafterthought, ‘we can give him a little surprise, to pay him out forbeing so late. Let’s get out of sight!’The other two ran quickly to the left and down into a little hollownot far from the road. There they lay flat. Frodo hesitated for asecond: curiosity or some other feeling was struggling with his desireto hide. The sound of hoofs drew nearer. Just in time he threw himselfdown in a patch of long grass behind a tree that overshadowed theroad. Then he lifted his head and peered cautiously above one of thegreat roots.Round the corner came a black horse, no hobbit-pony but a fullsized horse; and on it sat a large man, who seemed to crouch in thesaddle, wrapped in a great black cloak and hood, so that only hisboots in the high stirrups showed below; his face was shadowed andinvisible.T HR EE IS C OMPAN Y 75When itreached the tree and waslevel withFrodo the horse stopped.The riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed, asiflistening.Frominside the hood came a noise as of someone sniffing to catch an elusivescent; the head turned from side to side of the road.A sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of Frodo, andhe thought of his Ring. He hardly dared to breathe, and yet the desireto get it out of his pocket became so strong that he began slowly tomove his hand. He felt that he had only to slip it on, and then hewould be safe. The advice of Gandalf seemed absurd. Bilbo had usedthe Ring. ‘And I am still in the Shire,’ he thought, as his hand touchedthe chain on which it hung. At that moment the rider sat up, andshook the reins. The horse stepped forward, walking slowly at first,and then breaking into a quick trot.Frodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched the rider, untilhe dwindled into the distance. He could not be quite sure, but itseemed to him that suddenly, before it passed out of sight, the horseturned aside and went into the trees on the right.‘Well, I call that very queer, and indeed disturbing,’ said Frodoto himself, as he walked towards his companions. Pippin and Samhad remained flat in the grass, and had seen nothing; so Frododescribed the rider and his strange behaviour.‘I can’t say why, but I felt certain he was looking or smelling forme; and also I felt certain that I did not want him to discover me.I’ve never seen or felt anything like it in the Shire before.’‘But what has one of the Big People got to do with us?’ said Pippin.‘And what is he doing in this part of the world?’‘There are some Men about,’ said Frodo. ‘Down in the Southfarthing they have had trouble with Big People, I believe. But I havenever heard of anything like this rider. I wonder where he comesfrom.’‘Begging your pardon,’ put in Sam suddenly, ‘I know where hecomes from. It’s from Hobbiton that this here black rider comes,unless there’s more than one. And I know where he’s going to.’‘What do you mean?’ said Frodo sharply, looking at him in astonishment. ‘Why didn’t you speak up before?’‘I have only just remembered, sir. It was like this: when I got backto our hole yesterday evening with the key, my dad, he says to me:Hallo, Sam! he says. I thought you were away with Mr. Frodo thismorning. There’s been a strange customer asking for Mr. Baggins of BagEnd, and he’s only just gone. I’ve sent him on to Bucklebury. Not that Iliked the sound of him. He seemed mighty put out, when I told him Mr.Baggins had left his old home for good. Hissed at me, he did. It gave mequite a shudder. What sort of a fellow was he? says I to the Gaffer. Idon’t know, says he; but he wasn’t a hobbit. He was tall and black-like,76 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSand he stooped over me. I reckon it was one of the Big Folk from foreignparts. He spoke funny.‘I couldn’t stay to hear more, sir, since you were waiting; and Ididn’t give much heed to it myself. The Gaffer is getting old, andmore than a bit blind, and it must have been near dark when thisfellow come up the Hill and found him taking the air at the end ofour Row. I hope he hasn’t done no harm, sir, nor me.’‘The Gaffer can’t be blamed anyway,’ said Frodo. ‘As a matter offact I heard him talking to a stranger, who seemed to be inquiringfor me, and I nearly went and asked him who it was. I wish I had,or you had told me about it before. I might have been more carefulon the road.’‘Still, there may be no connexion between this rider and theGaffer’s stranger,’ said Pippin. ‘We left Hobbiton secretly enough,and I don’t see how he could have followed us.’‘What about the smelling, sir?’ said Sam. ‘And the Gaffer said hewas a black chap.’‘I wish I had waited for Gandalf,’ Frodo muttered. ‘But perhapsit would only have made matters worse.’‘Then you know or guess something about this rider?’ said Pippin,who had caught the muttered words.‘I don’t know, and I would rather not guess,’ said Frodo.‘All right, cousin Frodo! You can keep your secret for the present,if you want to be mysterious. In the meanwhile what are we to do?I should like a bite and a sup, but somehow I think we had bettermove on from here. Your talk of sniffing riders with invisible noseshas unsettled me.’‘Yes, I think we will move on now,’ said Frodo; ‘but not on theroad – in case that rider comes back, or another follows him. Weought to do a good step more today. Buckland is still miles away.’The shadows of the trees were long and thin on the grass, as theystarted off again. They now kept a stone’s throw to the left of theroad, and kept out of sight of it as much as they could. But thishindered them; for the grass was thick and tussocky, and the grounduneven, and the trees began to draw together into thickets.The sun had gone down red behind the hills at their backs, andevening was coming on before they came back to the road at the endof the long level over which it had run straight for some miles. Atthat point it bent left and went down into the lowlands of the Yalemaking for Stock; but a lane branched right, winding through a woodof ancient oak-trees on its way to Woodhall. ‘That is the way for us,’said Frodo.Not far from the road-meeting they came on the huge hulk of aT HR EE IS C OMPAN Y 77tree: it was still alive and had leaves on the small branches that ithad put out round the broken stumps of its long-fallen limbs; but itwas hollow, and could be entered by a great crack on the side awayfrom the road. The hobbits crept inside, and sat there upon a floorof old leaves and decayed wood. They rested and had a light meal,talking quietly and listening from time to time.Twilight was about them as they crept back to the lane. The Westwind was sighing in the branches. Leaves were whispering. Soon theroad began to fall gently but steadily into the dusk. A star came outabove the trees in the darkening East before them. They went abreastand in step, to keep up their spirits. After a time, as the stars grewthicker and brighter, the feeling of disquiet left them, and they nolonger listened for the sound of hoofs. They began to hum softly, ashobbits have a way of doing as they walk along, especially whenthey are drawing near to home at night. With most hobbits it is asupper-song or a bed-song; but these hobbits hummed a walking-song(though not, of course, without any mention of supper and bed).Bilbo Baggins had made the words, to a tune that was as old asthe hills, and taught it to Frodo as they walked in the lanes of theWater-valley and talked about Adventure.Upon the hearth the fire is red,Beneath the roof there is a bed;But not yet weary are our feet,Still round the corner we may meetA sudden tree or standing stoneThat none have seen but we alone.Tree and flower and leaf and grass,Let them pass! Let them pass!Hill and water under sky,Pass them by! Pass them by!Still round the corner there may waitA new road or a secret gate,And though we pass them by today,Tomorrow we may come this wayAnd take the hidden paths that runTowards the Moon or to the Sun.Apple, thorn, and nut and sloe,Let them go! Let them go!Sand and stone and pool and dell,Fare you well! Fare you well!78 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSHome is behind, the world ahead,And there are many paths to treadThrough shadows to the edge of night,Until the stars are all alight.Then world behind and home ahead,We’ll wander back to home and bed.Mist and twilight, cloud and shade,Away shall fade! Away shall fade!Fire and lamp, and meat and bread,And then to bed! And then to bed!The song ended. ‘And now to bed! And now to bed!’ sang Pippinin a high voice.‘Hush!’ said Frodo. ‘I think I hear hoofs again.’They stopped suddenly and stood as silent as tree-shadows, listening. There was a sound of hoofs in the lane, some way behind, butcoming slow and clear down the wind. Quickly and quietly theyslipped off the path, and ran into the deeper shade under the oaktrees.‘Don’t let us go too far!’ said Frodo. ‘I don’t want to be seen, butI want to see if it is another Black Rider.’‘Very well!’ said Pippin. ‘But don’t forget the sniffing!’The hoofs drew nearer. They had no time to find any hiding-placebetter than the general darkness under the trees; Sam and Pippincrouched behind a large tree-bole, while Frodo crept back a few yardstowards the lane. It showed grey and pale, a line of fading lightthrough the wood. Above it the stars were thick in the dim sky, butthere was no moon.The sound of hoofs stopped. As Frodo watched he saw somethingdark pass across the lighter space between two trees, and then halt.It looked like the black shade of a horse led by a smaller black shadow.The black shadow stood close to the point where they had left thepath, and it swayed from side to side. Frodo thought he heard thesound of snuffling. The shadow bent to the ground, and then beganto crawl towards him.Once more the desire to slip on the Ring came over Frodo; butthis time it was stronger than before. So strong that, almost beforehe realized what he was doing, his hand was groping in his pocket.But at that moment there came a sound like mingled song and laughter. Clear voices rose and fell in the starlit air. The black shadowstraightened up and retreated. It climbed on to the shadowy horseand seemed to vanish across the lane into the darkness on the otherside. Frodo breathed again.‘Elves!’ exclaimed Sam in a hoarse whisper. ‘Elves, sir!’ He wouldT HR EE IS C OMPAN Y 79have burst out of the trees and dashed off towards the voices, if theyhad not pulled him back.‘Yes, it is Elves,’ said Frodo. ‘One can meet them sometimes inthe Woody End. They don’t live in the Shire, but they wander intoit in spring and autumn, out of their own lands away beyond theTower Hills. I am thankful that they do! You did not see, but thatBlack Rider stopped just here and was actually crawling towards uswhen the song began. As soon as he heard the voices he slippedaway.’‘What about the Elves?’ said Sam, too excited to trouble aboutthe rider. ‘Can’t we go and see them?’‘Listen! They are coming this way,’ said Frodo. ‘We have only towait.’The singing drew nearer. One clear voice rose now above theothers. It was singing in the fair elven-tongue, of which Frodo knewonly a little, and the others knew nothing. Yet the sound blendingwith the melody seemed to shape itself in their thought into wordswhich they only partly understood. This was the song as Frodo heardit:Snow-white! Snow-white! O Lady clear!O Queen beyond the Western Seas!O Light to us that wander hereAmid the world of woven trees!Gilthoniel! O Elbereth!Clear are thy eyes and bright thy breath!Snow-white! Snow-white! We sing to theeIn a far land beyond the Sea.O stars that in the Sunless YearWith shining hand by her were sown,In windy fields now bright and clearWe see your silver blossom blown!O Elbereth! Gilthoniel!We still remember, we who dwellIn this far land beneath the trees,Thy starlight on the Western Seas.The song ended. ‘These are High Elves! They spoke the name ofElbereth!’ said Frodo in amazement. ‘Few of that fairest folk are everseen in the Shire. Not many now remain in Middle-earth, east of theGreat Sea. This is indeed a strange chance!’80 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSThe hobbits sat in shadow by the wayside. Before long the Elvescame down the lane towards the valley. They passed slowly, and thehobbits could see the starlight glimmering on their hair and in theireyes. They bore no lights, yet as they walked a shimmer, like thelight of the moon above the rim of the hills before it rises, seemedto fall about their feet. They were now silent, and as the last Elfpassed he turned and looked towards the hobbits and laughed.‘Hail, Frodo!’ he cried. ‘You are abroad late. Or are you perhapslost?’ Then he called aloud to the others, and all the company stoppedand gathered round.‘This is indeed wonderful!’ they said. ‘Three hobbits in a wood atnight! We have not seen such a thing since Bilbo went away. Whatis the meaning of it?’‘The meaning of it, fair people,’ said Frodo, ‘is simply that weseem to be going the same way as you are. I like walking under thestars. But I would welcome your company.’‘But we have no need of other company, and hobbits are so dull,’they laughed. ‘And how do you know that we go the same way asyou, for you do not know whither we are going?’‘And how do you know my name?’ asked Frodo in return.‘We know many things,’ they said. ‘We have seen you often beforewith Bilbo, though you may not have seen us.’‘Who are you, and who is your lord?’ asked Frodo.‘I am Gildor,’ answered their leader, the Elf who had first hailedhim. ‘Gildor Inglorion of the House of Finrod. We are Exiles, andmost of our kindred have long ago departed and we too are now onlytarrying here a while, ere we return over the Great Sea. But some ofour kinsfolk dwell still in peace in Rivendell. Come now, Frodo, tellus what you are doing? For we see that there is some shadow of fearupon you.’‘O Wise People!’ interrupted Pippin eagerly. ‘Tell us about theBlack Riders!’‘Black Riders?’ they said in low voices. ‘Why do you ask aboutBlack Riders?’‘Because two Black Riders have overtaken us today, or one hasdone so twice,’ said Pippin; ‘only a little while ago he slipped awayas you drew near.’The Elves did not answer at once, but spoke together softly intheir own tongue. At length Gildor turned to the hobbits. ‘We willnot speak of this here,’ he said. ‘We think you had best come nowwith us. It is not our custom, but for this time we will take you onour road, and you shall lodge with us tonight, if you will.’‘O Fair Folk! This is good fortune beyond my hope,’ said Pippin.Sam was speechless. ‘I thank you indeed, Gildor Inglorion,’ saidT HR EE IS C OMPAN Y 81Frodo bowing. ‘Elen sı´la lu´menn’ omentielvo, a star shines on the hourof our meeting,’ he added in the High-elven speech.‘Be careful, friends!’ cried Gildor laughing. ‘Speak no secrets! Hereis a scholar in the Ancient Tongue. Bilbo was a good master. Hail,Elf-friend!’ he said, bowing to Frodo. ‘Come now with your friendsand join our company! You had best walk in the middle so that youmay not stray. You may be weary before we halt.’‘Why? Where are you going?’ asked Frodo.‘For tonight we go to the woods on the hills above Woodhall. Itis some miles, but you shall have rest at the end of it, and it willshorten your journey tomorrow.’They now marched on again in silence, and passed like shadowsand faint lights: for Elves (even more than hobbits) could walk whenthey wished without sound or footfall. Pippin soon began to feelsleepy, and staggered once or twice; but each time a tall Elf at hisside put out his arm and saved him from a fall. Sam walked alongat Frodo’s side, as if in a dream, with an expression on his face halfof fear and half of astonished joy.The woods on either side became denser; the trees were nowyounger and thicker; and as the lane went lower, running down into afold of the hills, there were many deep brakes of hazel on the risingslopes at either hand. At last the Elves turned aside from the path. Agreen ride lay almost unseen through the thickets on the right; and thisthey followed as it wound away back up the wooded slopes on to thetop of a shoulder of the hills that stood out into the lower land of theriver-valley. Suddenly they came out of the shadow of the trees, andbefore them lay a wide space of grass, grey under the night. On threesides the woods pressed upon it; but eastward the ground fell steeplyand the tops of the dark trees, growing at the bottom of the slope, werebelow theirfeet. Beyond, the low landslay dim and flat underthe stars.Nearer at hand a few lights twinkled in the village of Woodhall.The Elves sat on the grass and spoke together in soft voices; theyseemed to take no further notice of the hobbits. Frodo and his companions wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets, and drowsinessstole over them. The night grew on, and the lights in the valley wentout. Pippin fell asleep, pillowed on a green hillock.Away high in the East swung Remmirath, the Netted Stars, andslowly above the mists red Borgil rose, glowing like a jewel of fire.Then by some shift of airs all the mist was drawn away like a veil,and there leaned up, as he climbed over the rim of the world, theSwordsman of the Sky, Menelvagor with his shining belt. The Elvesall burst into song. Suddenly under the trees a fire sprang up with ared light.82 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGS‘Come!’ the Elves called to the hobbits. ‘Come! Now is the timefor speech and merriment!’Pippin sat up and rubbed his eyes. He shivered. ‘There is a fire inthe hall, and food for hungry guests,’ said an Elf standing before him.At the south end of the greensward there was an opening. Therethe green floor ran on into the wood, and formed a wide space likea hall, roofed by the boughs of trees. Their great trunks ran likepillars down each side. In the middle there was a wood-fire blazing,and upon the tree-pillars torches with lights of gold and silver wereburning steadily. The Elves sat round the fire upon the grass or uponthe sawn rings of old trunks. Some went to and fro bearing cups andpouring drink; others brought food on heaped plates and dishes.‘This is poor fare,’ they said to the hobbits; ‘for we are lodging inthe greenwood far from our halls. If ever you are our guests at home,we will treat you better.’‘It seems to me good enough for a birthday-party,’ said Frodo.Pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink, for hismind was filled with the light upon the elf-faces, and the sound ofvoices so various and so beautiful that he felt in a waking dream. Buthe remembered that there was bread, surpassing the savour of a fairwhite loaf to one who is starving; and fruits sweet as wildberries andricher than the tended fruits of gardens; he drained a cup that wasfilled with a fragrant draught, cool as a clear fountain, golden as asummer afternoon.Sam could never describe in words, nor picture clearly to himself,what he felt or thought that night, though it remained in his memoryas one of the chief events of his life. The nearest he ever got was tosay: ‘Well, sir, if I could grow apples like that, I would call myself agardener. But it was the singing that went to my heart, if you knowwhat I mean.’Frodo sat, eating, drinking, and talking with delight; but his mindwas chiefly on the words spoken. He knew a little of the elf-speechand listened eagerly. Now and again he spoke to those that servedhim and thanked them in their own language. They smiled at himand said laughing: ‘Here is a jewel among hobbits!’After a while Pippin fell fast asleep, and was lifted up and borneaway to a bower under the trees; there he was laid upon a soft bedand slept the rest of the night away. Sam refused to leave his master.When Pippin had gone, he came and sat curled up at Frodo’s feet,where at last he nodded and closed his eyes. Frodo remained longawake, talking with Gildor.They spoke of many things, old and new, and Frodo questionedGildor much about happenings in the wide world outside the Shire.T HR EE IS C OMPAN Y 83The tidings were mostly sad and ominous: of gathering darkness, thewars of Men, and the flight of the Elves. At last Frodo asked thequestion that was nearest to his heart:‘Tell me, Gildor, have you ever seen Bilbo since he left us?’Gildor smiled. ‘Yes,’ he answered. ‘Twice. He said farewell to uson this very spot. But I saw him once again, far from here.’ He wouldsay no more about Bilbo, and Frodo fell silent.‘You do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself, Frodo,’said Gildor. ‘But I already know a little, and I can read more in yourface and in the thought behind your questions. You are leaving theShire, and yet you doubt that you will find what you seek, or accomplish what you intend, or that you will ever return. Is not that so?’‘It is,’ said Frodo; ‘but I thought my going was a secret knownonly to Gandalf and my faithful Sam.’ He looked down at Sam, whowas snoring gently.‘The secret will not reach the Enemy from us,’ said Gildor.‘The Enemy?’ said Frodo. ‘Then you know why I am leaving theShire?’‘I do not know for what reason the Enemy is pursuing you,’answered Gildor; ‘but I perceive that he is – strange indeed thoughthat seems to me. And I warn you that peril is now both before youand behind you, and upon either side.’‘You mean the Riders? I feared that they were servants of theEnemy. What are the Black Riders?’‘Has Gandalf told you nothing?’‘Nothing about such creatures.’‘Then I think it is not for me to say more – lest terror should keepyou from your journey. For it seems to me that you have set out onlyjust in time, if indeed you are in time. You must now make haste, andneither stay nor turn back; for the Shire is no longer any protection toyou.’‘I cannot imagine what information could be more terrifying thanyour hints and warnings,’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘I knew that danger layahead, of course; but I did not expect to meet it in our own Shire.Can’t a hobbit walk from the Water to the River in peace?’‘But it is not your own Shire,’ said Gildor. ‘Others dwelt herebefore hobbits were; and others will dwell here again when hobbits areno more. The wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in,but you cannot for ever fence it out.’‘I know – and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar. Whatcan I do now? My plan was to leave the Shire secretly, and make myway to Rivendell; but now my footsteps are dogged, before ever I getto Buckland.’‘I think you should still follow that plan,’ said Gildor. ‘I do not84 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSthink the Road will prove too hard for your courage. But if you desireclearer counsel, you should ask Gandalf. I do not know the reasonfor your flight, and therefore I do not know by what means yourpursuers will assail you. These things Gandalf must know. I supposethat you will see him before you leave the Shire?’‘I hope so. But that is another thing that makes me anxious. Ihave been expecting Gandalf for many days. He was to have cometo Hobbiton at the latest two nights ago; but he has never appeared.Now I am wondering what can have happened. Should I wait forhim?’Gildor was silent for a moment. ‘I do not like this news,’ he saidat last. ‘That Gandalf should be late, does not bode well. But it issaid: Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle andquick to anger. The choice is yours: to go or wait.’‘And it is also said,’ answered Frodo: ‘Go not to the Elves for counsel,for they will say both no and yes.’‘Is it indeed?’ laughed Gildor. ‘Elves seldom give unguardedadvice, for advice is a dangerous gift, even from the wise to the wise,and all courses may run ill. But what would you? You have not toldme all concerning yourself; and how then shall I choose better thanyou? But if you demand advice, I will for friendship’s sake give it. Ithink you should now go at once, without delay; and if Gandalf doesnot come before you set out, then I also advise this: do not go alone.Take such friends as are trusty and willing. Now you should begrateful, for I do not give this counsel gladly. The Elves have theirown labours and their own sorrows, and they are little concernedwith the ways of hobbits, or of any other creatures upon earth. Ourpaths cross theirs seldom, by chance or purpose. In this meeting theremay be more than chance; but the purpose is not clear to me, and Ifear to say too much.’‘I am deeply grateful,’ said Frodo; ‘but I wish you would tell meplainly what the Black Riders are. If I take your advice I may not seeGandalf for a long while, and I ought to know what is the dangerthat pursues me.’‘Is it not enough to know that they are servants of the Enemy?’answered Gildor. ‘Flee them! Speak no words to them! They aredeadly. Ask no more of me! But my heart forbodes that, ere all isended, you, Frodo son of Drogo, will know more of these fell thingsthan Gildor Inglorion. May Elbereth protect you!’‘But where shall I find courage?’ asked Frodo. ‘That is what Ichiefly need.’‘Courage is found in unlikely places,’ said Gildor. ‘Be of goodhope! Sleep now! In the morning we shall have gone; but we willsend our messages through the lands. The Wandering CompaniesT HR EE IS C OMPAN Y 85shall know of your journey, and those that have power for good shallbe on the watch. I name you Elf-friend; and may the stars shine uponthe end of your road! Seldom have we had such delight in strangers,and it is fair to hear words of the Ancient Speech from the lips ofother wanderers in the world.’Frodo felt sleep coming upon him, even as Gildor finished speaking. ‘I will sleep now,’ he said; and the Elf led him to a bower besidePippin, and he threw himself upon a bed and fell at once into adreamless slumber.Chapter 4A SHORT CUT T O MUSHROOMSIn the morning Frodo woke refreshed. He was lying in a bower madeby a living tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground; hisbed was of fern and grass, deep and soft and strangely fragrant. Thesun was shining through the fluttering leaves, which were still greenupon the tree. He jumped up and went out.Sam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood. Pippinwas standing studying the sky and weather. There was no sign of theElves.‘They have left us fruit and drink, and bread,’ said Pippin. ‘Comeand have your breakfast. The bread tastes almost as good as it didlast night. I did not want to leave you any, but Sam insisted.’Frodo sat down beside Sam and began to eat. ‘What is the planfor today?’ asked Pippin.‘To walk to Bucklebury as quickly as possible,’ answered Frodo,and gave his attention to the food.‘Do you think we shall see anything of those Riders?’ asked Pippincheerfully. Under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a wholetroop of them did not seem very alarming to him.‘Yes, probably,’ said Frodo, not liking the reminder. ‘But I hopeto get across the river without their seeing us.’‘Did you find out anything about them from Gildor?’‘Not much – only hints and riddles,’ said Frodo evasively.‘Did you ask about the sniffing?’‘We didn’t discuss it,’ said Frodo with his mouth full.‘You should have. I am sure it is very important.’‘In that case I am sure Gildor would have refused to explain it,’ saidFrodo sharply. ‘And now leave me in peace for a bit! I don’t want toanswer a string of questions while I am eating. I want to think!’‘Good heavens!’ said Pippin. ‘At breakfast?’ He walked awaytowards the edge of the green.From Frodo’s mind the bright morning – treacherously bright, hethought – had not banished the fear of pursuit; and he pondered thewords of Gildor. The merry voice of Pippin came to him. He wasrunning on the green turf and singing.‘No! I could not!’ he said to himself. ‘It is one thing to take myyoung friends walking over the Shire with me, until we are hungryand weary, and food and bed are sweet. To take them into exile,where hunger and weariness may have no cure, is quite another –A SH O R T CU T T O MU SHRO OMS 87even if they are willing to come. The inheritance is mine alone. Idon’t think I ought even to take Sam.’ He looked at Sam Gamgee,and discovered that Sam was watching him.‘Well, Sam!’ he said. ‘What about it? I am leaving the Shire assoon as ever I can – in fact I have made up my mind now not evento wait a day at Crickhollow, if it can be helped.’‘Very good, sir!’‘You still mean to come with me?’‘I do.’‘It is going to be very dangerous, Sam. It is already dangerous.Most likely neither of us will come back.’‘If you don’t come back, sir, then I shan’t, that’s certain,’ saidSam. ‘Don’t you leave him! they said to me. Leave him! I said. I nevermean to. I am going with him, if he climbs to the Moon; and if any ofthose Black Riders try to stop him, they’ll have Sam Gamgee to reckonwith, I said. They laughed.’‘Who are they, and what are you talking about?’‘The Elves, sir. We had some talk last night; and they seemed toknow you were going away, so I didn’t see the use of denying it.Wonderful folk, Elves, sir! Wonderful!’‘They are,’ said Frodo. ‘Do you like them still, now you have hada closer view?’‘They seem a bit above my likes and dislikes, so to speak,’ answeredSam slowly. ‘It don’t seem to matter what I think about them. Theyare quite different from what I expected – so old and young, and sogay and sad, as it were.’Frodo looked at Sam rather startled, half expecting to see someoutward sign of the odd change that seemed to have come over him.It did not sound like the voice of the old Sam Gamgee that he thoughthe knew. But it looked like the old Sam Gamgee sitting there, exceptthat his face was unusually thoughtful.‘Do you feel any need to leave the Shire now – now that your wishto see them has come true already?’ he asked.‘Yes, sir. I don’t know how to say it, but after last night I feeldifferent. I seem to see ahead, in a kind of way. I know we are goingto take a very long road, into darkness; but I know I can’t turn back.It isn’t to see Elves now, nor dragons, nor mountains, that I want –I don’t rightly know what I want: but I have something to do beforethe end, and it lies ahead, not in the Shire. I must see it through,sir, if you understand me.’‘I don’t altogether. But I understand that Gandalf chose me agood companion. I am content. We will go together.’Frodo finished his breakfast in silence. Then standing up he lookedover the land ahead, and called to Pippin.88 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGS‘All ready to start?’ he said as Pippin ran up. ‘We must be gettingoff at once. We slept late; and there are a good many miles to go.’‘You slept late, you mean,’ said Pippin. ‘I was up long before; andwe are only waiting for you to finish eating and thinking.’‘I have finished both now. And I am going to make for BuckleburyFerry as quickly as possible. I am not going out of the way, back tothe road we left last night: I am going to cut straight across countryfrom here.’‘Then you are going to fly,’ said Pippin. ‘You won’t cut straighton foot anywhere in this country.’‘We can cut straighter than the road anyway,’ answered Frodo.‘The Ferry is east from Woodhall; but the hard road curves away tothe left – you can see a bend of it away north over there. It goesround the north end of the Marish so as to strike the causeway fromthe Bridge above Stock. But that is miles out of the way. We couldsave a quarter of the distance if we made a line for the Ferry fromwhere we stand.’‘Short cuts make long delays,’ argued Pippin. ‘The country is roughround here, and there are bogs and all kinds of difficulties down inthe Marish – I know the land in these parts. And if you are worryingabout Black Riders, I can’t see that it is any worse meeting them ona road than in a wood or a field.’‘It is less easy to find people in the woods and fields,’ answeredFrodo. ‘And if you are supposed to be on the road, there is somechance that you will be looked for on the road and not off it.’‘All right!’ said Pippin. ‘I will follow you into every bog and ditch.But it is hard! I had counted on passing the Golden Perch at Stockbefore sundown. The best beer in the Eastfarthing, or used to be: itis a long time since I tasted it.’‘That settles it!’ said Frodo. ‘Short cuts make delays, but innsmake longer ones. At all costs we must keep you away from theGolden Perch. We want to get to Bucklebury before dark. What doyou say, Sam?’‘I will go along with you, Mr. Frodo,’ said Sam (in spite of privatemisgivings and a deep regret for the best beer in the Eastfarthing).‘Then if we are going to toil through bog and briar, let’s go now!’said Pippin.It was already nearly as hot as it had been the day before; butclouds were beginning to come up from the West. It looked likely toturn to rain. The hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank andplunged into the thick trees below. Their course had been chosen toleave Woodhall to their left, and to cut slanting through the woodsthat clustered along the eastern side of the hills, until they reachedA SH O R T CU T T O MU SHRO OMS 89the flats beyond. Then they could make straight for the Ferry overcountry that was open, except for a few ditches and fences. Frodoreckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line.He soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled thanit had appeared. There were no paths in the undergrowth, and theydid not get on very fast. When they had struggled to the bottom ofthe bank, they found a stream running down from the hills behindin a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung with brambles.Most inconveniently it cut across the line they had chosen. Theycould not jump over it, nor indeed get across it at all without gettingwet, scratched, and muddy. They halted, wondering what to do.‘First check!’ said Pippin, smiling grimly.Sam Gamgee looked back. Through an opening in the trees hecaught a glimpse of the top of the green bank from which they hadclimbed down.‘Look!’ he said, clutching Frodo by the arm. They all looked, andon the edge high above them they saw against the sky a horse standing.Beside it stooped a black figure.They at once gave up any idea of going back. Frodo led the way,and plunged quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream. ‘Whew!’he said to Pippin. ‘We were both right! The short cut has gonecrooked already; but we got under cover only just in time. You’vegot sharp ears, Sam: can you hear anything coming?’They stood still, almost holding their breath as they listened; butthere was no sound of pursuit. ‘I don’t fancy he would try bringinghis horse down that bank,’ said Sam. ‘But I guess he knows we camedown it. We had better be going on.’Going on was not altogether easy. They had packs to carry, andthe bushes and brambles were reluctant to let them through. Theywere cut off from the wind by the ridge behind, and the air was stilland stuffy. When they forced their way at last into more open ground,they were hot and tired and very scratched, and they were also nolonger certain of the direction in which they were going. The banksof the stream sank, as it reached the levels and became broader andshallower, wandering off towards the Marish and the River.‘Why, this is the Stock-brook!’ said Pippin. ‘If we are going to tryand get back on to our course, we must cross at once and bear right.’They waded the stream, and hurried over a wide open space,rush-grown and treeless, on the further side. Beyond that they cameagain to a belt of trees: tall oaks, for the most part, with here andthere an elm tree or an ash. The ground was fairly level, and therewas little undergrowth; but the trees were too close for them to seefar ahead. The leaves blew upwards in sudden gusts of wind, andspots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky. Then the wind died90 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSaway and the rain came streaming down. They trudged along as fastas they could, over patches of grass, and through thick drifts of oldleaves; and all about them the rain pattered and trickled. They didnot talk, but kept glancing back, and from side to side.After half an hour Pippin said: ‘I hope we have not turned toomuch towards the south, and are not walking longwise through thiswood! It is not a very broad belt – I should have said no more thana mile at the widest – and we ought to have been through it by now.’‘It is no good our starting to go in zig-zags,’ said Frodo. ‘Thatwon’t mend matters. Let us keep on as we are going! I am not surethat I want to come out into the open yet.’They went on for perhaps another couple of miles. Then the sungleamed out of ragged clouds again and the rain lessened. It was nowpast mid-day, and they felt it was high time for lunch. They haltedunder an elm tree: its leaves though fast turning yellow were stillthick, and the ground at its feet was fairly dry and sheltered. Whenthey came to make their meal, they found that the Elves had filledtheir bottles with a clear drink, pale golden in colour: it had the scentof a honey made of many flowers, and was wonderfully refreshing.Very soon they were laughing, and snapping their fingers at rain, andat Black Riders. The last few miles, they felt, would soon be behindthem.Frodo propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes.Sam and Pippin sat near, and they began to hum, and then to singsoftly:Ho! Ho! Ho! to the bottle I goTo heal my heart and drown my woe.Rain may fall and wind may blow,And many miles be still to go,But under a tall tree I will lie,And let the clouds go sailing by.Ho! Ho! Ho! they began again louder. They stopped short suddenly.Frodo sprang to his feet. A long-drawn wail came down the wind,like the cry of some evil and lonely creature. It rose and fell, andended on a high piercing note. Even as they sat and stood, as ifsuddenly frozen, it was answered by another cry, fainter and furtheroff, but no less chilling to the blood. There was then a silence, brokenonly by the sound of the wind in the leaves.‘And what do you think that was?’ Pippin asked at last, trying tospeak lightly, but quavering a little. ‘If it was a bird, it was one thatI never heard in the Shire before.’A SH O R T CU T T O MU SHRO OMS 91‘It was not bird or beast,’ said Frodo. ‘It was a call, or a signal –there were words in that cry, though I could not catch them. But nohobbit has such a voice.’No more was said about it. They were all thinking of the Riders,but no one spoke of them. They were now reluctant either to stayor go on; but sooner or later they had got to get across the opencountry to the Ferry, and it was best to go sooner and in daylight.In a few moments they had shouldered their packs again and wereoff.Before long the wood came to a sudden end. Wide grass-landsstretched before them. They now saw that they had, in fact, turnedtoo much to the south. Away over the flats they could glimpse thelow hill of Bucklebury across the River, but it was now to their left.Creeping cautiously out from the edge of the trees, they set off acrossthe open as quickly as they could.At first they felt afraid, away from the shelter of the wood. Farback behind them stood the high place where they had breakfasted.Frodo half expected to see the small distant figure of a horseman onthe ridge dark against the sky; but there was no sign of one. The sunescaping from the breaking clouds, as it sank towards the hills theyhad left, was now shining brightly again. Their fear left them, thoughthey still felt uneasy. But the land became steadily more tame andwell-ordered. Soon they came into well-tended fields and meadows:there were hedges and gates and dikes for drainage. Everythingseemed quiet and peaceful, just an ordinary corner of the Shire. Theirspirits rose with every step. The line of the River grew nearer; andthe Black Riders began to seem like phantoms of the woods now leftfar behind.They passed along the edge of a huge turnip-field, and came to astout gate. Beyond it a rutted lane ran between low well-laid hedgestowards a distant clump of trees. Pippin stopped.‘I know these fields and this gate!’ he said. ‘This is Bamfurlong,old Farmer Maggot’s land. That’s his farm away there in the trees.’‘One trouble after another!’ said Frodo, looking nearly as muchalarmed as if Pippin had declared the lane was the slot leading to adragon’s den. The others looked at him in surprise.‘What’s wrong with old Maggot?’ asked Pippin. ‘He’s a good friendto all the Brandybucks. Of course he’s a terror to trespassers, andkeeps ferocious dogs – but after all, folk down here are near theborder and have to be more on their guard.’‘I know,’ said Frodo. ‘But all the same,’ he added with a shamefaced laugh, ‘I am terrified of him and his dogs. I have avoided hisfarm for years and years. He caught me several times trespassing after92 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSmushrooms, when I was a youngster at Brandy Hall. On the lastoccasion he beat me, and then took me and showed me to his dogs.‘‘See, lads,’’ he said, ‘‘next time this young varmint sets foot on myland, you can eat him. Now see him off!’’ They chased me all theway to the Ferry. I have never got over the fright – though I daresaythe beasts knew their business and would not really have touchedme.’Pippin laughed. ‘Well, it’s time you made it up. Especially if youare coming back to live in Buckland. Old Maggot is really a stoutfellow – if you leave his mushrooms alone. Let’s get into the laneand then we shan’t be trespassing. If we meet him, I’ll do the talking.He is a friend of Merry’s, and I used to come here with him a gooddeal at one time.’They went along the lane, until they saw the thatched roofs of alarge house and farm-buildings peeping out among the trees ahead.The Maggots, and the Puddifoots of Stock, and most of the inhabitants of the Marish, were house-dwellers; and this farm was stoutlybuilt of brick and had a high wall all round it. There was a widewooden gate opening out of the wall into the lane.Suddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying and barking brokeout, and a loud voice was heard shouting: ‘Grip! Fang! Wolf! Comeon, lads!’Frodo and Sam stopped dead, but Pippin walked on a few paces.The gate opened and three huge dogs came pelting out into the lane,and dashed towards the travellers, barking fiercely. They took nonotice of Pippin; but Sam shrank against the wall, while two wolvishlooking dogs sniffed at him suspiciously, and snarled if he moved.The largest and most ferocious of the three halted in front of Frodo,bristling and growling.Through the gate there now appeared a broad thick-set hobbitwith a round red face. ‘Hallo! Hallo! And who may you be, and whatmay you be wanting?’ he asked.‘Good afternoon, Mr. Maggot!’ said Pippin.The farmer looked at him closely. ‘Well, if it isn’t Master Pippin– Mr. Peregrin Took, I should say!’ he cried, changing from a scowlto a grin. ‘It’s a long time since I saw you round here. It’s lucky foryou that I know you. I was just going out to set my dogs on anystrangers. There are some funny things going on today. Of course,we do get queer folk wandering in these parts at times. Too nearthe River,’ he said, shaking his head. ‘But this fellow was the mostoutlandish I have ever set eyes on. He won’t cross my land withoutleave a second time, not if I can stop it.’‘What fellow do you mean?’ asked Pippin.A SH O R T CU T T O MU SHRO OMS 93‘Then you haven’t seen him?’ said the farmer. ‘He went up thelane towards the causeway not a long while back. He was a funnycustomer and asking funny questions. But perhaps you’ll come alonginside, and we’ll pass the news more comfortable. I’ve a drop of goodale on tap, if you and your friends are willing, Mr. Took.’It seemed plain that the farmer would tell them more, if allowedto do it in his own time and fashion, so they all accepted the invitation.‘What about the dogs?’ asked Frodo anxiously.The farmer laughed. ‘They won’t harm you – not unless I tell ’emto. Here, Grip! Fang! Heel!’ he cried. ‘Heel, Wolf!’ To the relief ofFrodo and Sam, the dogs walked away and let them go free.Pippin introduced the othertwo to the farmer. ‘Mr. FrodoBaggins,’he said. ‘You may not remember him, but he used to live at BrandyHall.’ At the name Baggins the farmer started, and gave Frodo asharp glance. For a moment Frodo thought that the memory of stolenmushrooms had been aroused, and that the dogs would be told tosee him off. But Farmer Maggot took him by the arm.‘Well, if that isn’t queerer than ever!’ he exclaimed. ‘Mr. Bagginsis it? Come inside! We must have a talk.’They went into the farmer’s kitchen, and sat by the wide fire-place.Mrs. Maggot brought out beer in a huge jug, and filled four largemugs. It was a good brew, and Pippin found himself more thancompensated for missing the Golden Perch. Sam sipped his beer suspiciously. He had a natural mistrust of the inhabitants of other partsof the Shire; and also he was not disposed to be quick friends withanyone who had beaten his master, however long ago.After a few remarks about the weather and the agricultural prospects (which were no worse than usual), Farmer Maggot put downhis mug and looked at them all in turn.‘Now, Mr. Peregrin,’ he said, ‘where might you be coming from,and where might you be going to? Were you coming to visit me? For,if so, you had gone past my gate without my seeing you.’‘Well, no,’ answered Pippin. ‘To tell you the truth, since you haveguessed it, we got into the lane from the other end: we had comeover your fields. But that was quite by accident. We lost our way inthe woods, back near Woodhall, trying to take a short cut to theFerry.’‘If you were in a hurry, the road would have served you better,’said the farmer. ‘But I wasn’t worrying about that. You have leaveto walk over my land, if you have a mind, Mr. Peregrin. And you,Mr. Baggins – though I daresay you still like mushrooms.’ He laughed.‘Ah yes, I recognized the name. I recollect the time when youngFrodo Baggins was one of the worst young rascals of Buckland. Butit wasn’t mushrooms I was thinking of. I had just heard the name94 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSBaggins before you turned up. What do you think that funny customerasked me?’They waited anxiously for him to go on. ‘Well,’ the farmer continued, approaching his point with slow relish, ‘he came riding on abig black horse in at the gate, which happened to be open, and rightup to my door. All black he was himself, too, and cloaked and hoodedup, as if he did not want to be known. ‘‘Now what in the Shire canhe want?’’ I thought to myself. We don’t see many of the Big Folkover the border; and anyway I had never heard of any like this blackfellow.‘ ‘‘Good-day to you!’’ I says, going out to him. ‘‘This lane don’tlead anywhere, and wherever you may be going, your quickest waywill be back to the road.’’ I didn’t like the looks of him; and whenGrip came out, he took one sniff and let out a yelp as if he had beenstung: he put down his tail and bolted off howling. The black fellowsat quite still.‘ ‘‘I come from yonder,’’ he said, slow and stiff-like, pointing backwest, over my fields, if you please. ‘‘Have you seen Baggins?’’ heasked in a queer voice, and bent down towards me. I could not seeany face, for his hood fell down so low; and I felt a sort of shiverdown my back. But I did not see why he should come riding overmy land so bold.‘ ‘‘Be off!’’ I said. ‘‘There are no Bagginses here. You’re in thewrong part of the Shire. You had better go back west to Hobbiton– but you can go by road this time.’’‘ ‘‘Baggins has left,’’ he answered in a whisper. ‘‘He is coming. Heis not far away. I wish to find him. If he passes will you tell me? Iwill come back with gold.’’‘ ‘‘No you won’t,’’ I said. ‘‘You’ll go back where you belong,double quick. I give you one minute before I call all my dogs.’’‘He gave a sort of hiss. It might have been laughing, and it mightnot. Then he spurred his great horse right at me, and I jumped outof the way only just in time. I called the dogs, but he swung off, androde through the gate and up the lane towards the causeway like abolt of thunder. What do you think of that?’Frodo sat for a moment looking at the fire, but his only thoughtwas how on earth would they reach the Ferry. ‘I don’t know whatto think,’ he said at last.‘Then I’ll tell you what to think,’ said Maggot. ‘You should neverhave gone mixing yourself up with Hobbiton folk, Mr. Frodo. Folkare queer up there.’ Sam stirred in his chair, and looked at the farmerwith an unfriendly eye. ‘But you were always a reckless lad. When Iheard you had left the Brandybucks and gone off to that old Mr.Bilbo, I said that you were going to find trouble. Mark my words,A SH O R T CU T T O MU SHRO OMS 95this all comes of those strange doings of Mr. Bilbo’s. His money wasgot in some strange fashion in foreign parts, they say. Maybe thereis some that want to know what has become of the gold and jewelsthat he buried in the hill of Hobbiton, as I hear?’Frodo said nothing: the shrewd guesses of the farmer were ratherdisconcerting.‘Well, Mr. Frodo,’ Maggot went on, ‘I’m glad that you’ve had thesense to come back to Buckland. My advice is: stay there! And don’tget mixed up with these outlandish folk. You’ll have friends in theseparts. If any of these black fellows come after you again, I’ll dealwith them. I’ll say you’re dead, or have left the Shire, or anythingyou like. And that might be true enough; for as like as not it is oldMr. Bilbo they want news of.’‘Maybe you’re right,’ said Frodo, avoiding the farmer’s eye andstaring at the fire.Maggot looked at him thoughtfully. ‘Well, I see you have ideas ofyour own,’ he said. ‘It is as plain as my nose that no accident broughtyou and that rider here on the same afternoon; and maybe my newswas no great news to you, after all. I am not asking you to tell meanything you have a mind to keep to yourself; but I see you are insome kind of trouble. Perhaps you are thinking it won’t be too easyto get to the Ferry without being caught?’‘I was thinking so,’ said Frodo. ‘But we have got to try and getthere; and it won’t be done by sitting and thinking. So I am afraidwe must be going. Thank you very much indeed for your kindness!I’ve been in terror of you and your dogs for over thirty years, FarmerMaggot, though you may laugh to hear it. It’s a pity: for I’ve misseda good friend. And now I’m sorry to leave so soon. But I’ll comeback, perhaps, one day – if I get a chance.’‘You’ll be welcome when you come,’ said Maggot. ‘But now I’vea notion. It’s near sundown already, and we are going to have oursupper; for we mostly go to bed soon after the Sun. If you and Mr.Peregrin and all could stay and have a bite with us, we would bepleased!’‘And so should we!’ said Frodo. ‘But we must be going at once,I’m afraid. Even now it will be dark before we can reach the Ferry.’‘Ah! but wait a minute! I was going to say: after a bit of supper,I’ll get out a small waggon, and I’ll drive you all to the Ferry. Thatwill save you a good step, and it might also save you trouble ofanother sort.’Frodo now accepted the invitation gratefully, to the relief of Pippinand Sam. The sun was already behind the western hills, and the lightwas failing. Two of Maggot’s sons and his three daughters came in,and a generous supper was laid on the large table. The kitchen was96 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSlit with candles and the fire was mended. Mrs. Maggot bustled inand out. One or two other hobbits belonging to the farm-householdcame in. In a short while fourteen sat down to eat. There was beerin plenty, and a mighty dish of mushrooms and bacon, besides muchother solid farmhouse fare. The dogs lay by the fire and gnawed rindsand cracked bones.When they had finished, the farmer and his sons went out with alantern and got the waggon ready. It was dark in the yard, when theguests came out. They threw their packs on board and climbed in.The farmer sat in the driving-seat, and whipped up his two stoutponies. His wife stood in the light of the open door.‘You be careful of yourself, Maggot!’ she called. ‘Don’t go arguingwith any foreigners, and come straight back!’‘I will!’ said he, and drove out of the gate. There was now nobreath of wind stirring; the night was still and quiet, and a chill wasin the air. They went without lights and took it slowly. After a mileor two the lane came to an end, crossing a deep dike, and climbinga short slope up on to the high-banked causeway.Maggot got down and took a good look either way, north andsouth, but nothing could be seen in the darkness, and there was nota sound in the still air. Thin strands of river-mist were hanging abovethe dikes, and crawling over the fields.‘It’s going to be thick,’ said Maggot; ‘but I’ll not light my lanternstill I turn for home. We’ll hear anything on the road long before wemeet it tonight.’It was five miles or more from Maggot’s lane to the Ferry. Thehobbits wrapped themselves up, but their ears were strained for anysound above the creak of the wheels and the slow clop of the ponies’hoofs. The waggon seemed slower than a snail to Frodo. Beside himPippin was nodding towards sleep; but Sam was staring forwardsinto the rising fog.They reached the entrance to the Ferry lane at last. It was markedby two tall white posts that suddenly loomed up on their right. FarmerMaggot drew in his ponies and the waggon creaked to a halt. Theywere just beginning to scramble out, when suddenly they heard whatthey had all been dreading: hoofs on the road ahead. The sound wascoming towards them.Maggot jumped down and stood holding the ponies’ heads, andpeering forward into the gloom. Clip-clop, clip-clop came the approaching rider. The fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still, foggy air.‘You’d better be hidden, Mr. Frodo,’ said Sam anxiously. ‘Youget down in the waggon and cover up with blankets, and we’ll sendthis rider to the rightabouts!’ He climbed out and went to the farmer’sA SH O R T CU T T O MU SHRO OMS 97side. Black Riders would have to ride over him to get near the waggon.Clop-clop, clop-clop. The rider was nearly on them.‘Hallo there!’ called Farmer Maggot. The advancing hoofs stoppedshort. They thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape inthe mist, a yard or two ahead.‘Now then!’ said the farmer, throwing the reins to Sam and stridingforward. ‘Don’t you come a step nearer! What do you want, andwhere are you going?’‘I want Mr. Baggins. Have you seen him?’ said a muffled voice –but the voice was the voice of Merry Brandybuck. A dark lanternwas uncovered, and its light fell on the astonished face of the farmer.‘Mr. Merry!’ he cried.‘Yes, of course! Who did you think it was?’ said Merry comingforward. As he came out of the mist and their fears subsided, heseemed suddenly to diminish to ordinary hobbit-size. He was ridinga pony, and a scarf was swathed round his neck and over his chin tokeep out the fog.Frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him. ‘So there you areat last!’ said Merry. ‘I was beginning to wonder if you would turnup at all today, and I was just going back to supper. When it grewfoggy I came across and rode up towards Stock to see if you hadfallen in any ditches. But I’m blest if I know which way you havecome. Where did you find them, Mr. Maggot? In your duck-pond?’‘No, I caught ’em trespassing,’ said the farmer, ‘and nearly set mydogs on ’em; but they’ll tell you all the story, I’ve no doubt. Now,if you’ll excuse me, Mr. Merry and Mr. Frodo and all, I’d best beturning for home. Mrs. Maggot will be worriting with the nightgetting thick.’He backed the waggon into the lane and turned it. ‘Well, goodnight to you all,’ he said. ‘It’s been a queer day, and no mistake. Butall’s well as ends well; though perhaps we should not say that untilwe reach our own doors. I’ll not deny that I’ll be glad now when Ido.’ He lit his lanterns, and got up. Suddenly he produced a largebasket from under the seat. ‘I was nearly forgetting,’ he said. ‘Mrs.Maggot put this up for Mr. Baggins, with her compliments.’ Hehanded it down and moved off, followed by a chorus of thanks andgood-nights.They watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns as theydwindled into the foggy night. Suddenly Frodo laughed: from thecovered basket he held, the scent of mushrooms was rising.Chapter 5A CONSPIRACY UNMASKED‘Now we had better get home ourselves,’ said Merry. ‘There’s something funny about all this, I see; but it must wait till we get in.’They turned down the Ferry lane, which was straight and well-keptand edged with large white-washed stones. In a hundred yards or soit brought them to the river-bank, where there was a broad woodenlanding-stage. A large flat ferry-boat was moored beside it. The whitebollards near the water’s edge glimmered in the light of two lampson high posts. Behind them the mists in the flat fields were nowabove the hedges; but the water before them was dark, with only afew curling wisps like steam among the reeds by the bank. Thereseemed to be less fog on the further side.Merry led the pony over a gangway on to the ferry, and the othersfollowed. Merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole. The Brandywine flowed slow and broad before them. On the other side the bankwas steep, and up it a winding path climbed from the further landing.Lamps were twinkling there. Behind loomed up the Buck Hill; andout of it, through stray shrouds of mist, shone many round windows,yellow and red. They were the windows of Brandy Hall, the ancienthome of the Brandybucks.Long ago Gorhendad Oldbuck, head of the Oldbuck family, oneof the oldest in the Marish or indeed in the Shire, had crossed theriver, which was the original boundary of the land eastwards. Hebuilt (and excavated) Brandy Hall, changed his name to Brandybuck,and settled down to become master of what was virtually a smallindependent country. His family grew and grew, and after his dayscontinued to grow, until Brandy Hall occupied the whole of the lowhill, and had three large front-doors, many side-doors, and about ahundred windows. The Brandybucks and their numerous dependantsthen began to burrow, and later to build, all round about. That wasthe origin of Buckland, a thickly inhabited strip between the riverand the Old Forest, a sort of colony from the Shire. Its chief villagewas Bucklebury, clustering in the banks and slopes behind BrandyHall.The people in the Marish were friendly with the Bucklanders, andthe authority of the Master of the Hall (as the head of the Brandybuckfamily was called) was still acknowledged by the farmers betweenStock and Rushey. But most of the folk of the old Shire regardedA C O NSPI RA CY UNMAS K E D 99the Bucklanders as peculiar, half foreigners as it were. Though, as amatter of fact, they were not very different from the other hobbits ofthe Four Farthings. Except in one point: they were fond of boats,and some of them could swim.Their land was originally unprotected from the East; but on thatside they had built a hedge: the High Hay. It had been planted manygenerations ago, and was now thick and tall, for it was constantlytended. It ran all the way from Brandywine Bridge, in a big loopcurving away from the river, to Haysend (where the Withywindleflowed out of the Forest into the Brandywine): well over twenty milesfrom end to end. But, of course, it was not a complete protection.The Forest drew close to the hedge in many places. The Bucklanderskept their doors locked after dark, and that also was not usual in theShire.The ferry-boat moved slowly across the water. The Buckland shoredrew nearer. Sam was the only member of the party who had notbeen over the river before. He had a strange feeling as the slowgurgling stream slipped by: his old life lay behind in the mists, darkadventure lay in front. He scratched his head, and for a moment hada passing wish that Mr. Frodo could have gone on living quietly atBag End.The four hobbits stepped off the ferry. Merry was tying it up, andPippin was already leading the pony up the path, when Sam (whohad been looking back, as if to take farewell of the Shire) said in ahoarse whisper:‘Look back, Mr. Frodo! Do you see anything?’On the far stage, under the distant lamps, they could just makeout a figure: it looked like a dark black bundle left behind. But asthey looked it seemed to move and sway this way and that, as ifsearching the ground. It then crawled, or went crouching, back intothe gloom beyond the lamps.‘What in the Shire is that?’ exclaimed Merry.‘Something that is following us,’ said Frodo. ‘But don’t ask anymore now! Let’s get away at once!’ They hurried up the path to thetop of the bank, but when they looked back the far shore was shroudedin mist, and nothing could be seen.‘Thank goodness you don’t keep any boats on the west-bank!’ saidFrodo. ‘Can horses cross the river?’‘They can go ten miles north to Brandywine Bridge – or theymight swim,’ answered Merry. ‘Though I never heard of any horseswimming the Brandywine. But what have horses to do with it?’‘I’ll tell you later. Let’s get indoors and then we can talk.’‘All right! You and Pippin know your way; so I’ll just ride on and100 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGStell Fatty Bolger that you are coming. We’ll see about supper andthings.’‘We had our supper early with Farmer Maggot,’ said Frodo; ‘butwe could do with another.’‘You shall have it! Give me that basket!’ said Merry, and rodeahead into the darkness.It was some distance from the Brandywine to Frodo’s new houseat Crickhollow. They passed Buck Hill and Brandy Hall on their left,and on the outskirts of Bucklebury struck the main road of Bucklandthat ran south from the Bridge. Half a mile northward along this theycame to a lane opening on their right. This they followed for a coupleof miles as it climbed up and down into the country.At last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge. Nothing couldbe seen of the house in the dark: it stood back from the lane in themiddle of a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of low treesinside the outer hedge. Frodo had chosen it, because it stood in anout-of-the-way corner of the country, and there were no other dwellings close by. You could get in and out without being noticed. It hadbeen built a long while before by the Brandybucks, for the use ofguests, or members of the family that wished to escape from thecrowded life of Brandy Hall for a time. It was an old-fashionedcountrified house, as much like a hobbit-hole as possible: it was longand low, with no upper storey; and it had a roof of turf, roundwindows, and a large round door.As they walked up the green path from the gate no light was visible;the windows were dark and shuttered. Frodo knocked on the door,and Fatty Bolger opened it. A friendly light streamed out. Theyslipped in quickly and shut themselves and the light inside. Theywere in a wide hall with doors on either side; in front of them apassage ran back down the middle of the house.‘Well, what do you think of it?’ asked Merry coming up the passage.‘We have done our best in a short time to make it look like home. Afterall Fatty and I only got here with the last cart-load yesterday.’Frodo looked round. It did look like home. Many of his ownfavourite things – or Bilbo’s things (they reminded him sharply ofhim in their new setting) – were arranged as nearly as possible asthey had been at Bag End. It was a pleasant, comfortable, welcomingplace; and he found himself wishing that he was really coming hereto settle down in quiet retirement. It seemed unfair to have put hisfriends to all this trouble; and he wondered again how he was goingto break the news to them that he must leave them so soon, indeedat once. Yet that would have to be done that very night, before theyall went to bed.A C O NSPI RA CY UNMAS K E D 101‘It’s delightful!’ he said with an effort. ‘I hardly feel that I havemoved at all.’The travellers hung up their cloaks, and piled their packs on thefloor. Merry led them down the passage and threw open a door atthe far end. Firelight came out, and a puff of steam.‘A bath!’ cried Pippin. ‘O blessed Meriadoc!’‘Which order shall we go in?’ said Frodo. ‘Eldest first, or quickestfirst? You’ll be last either way, Master Peregrin.’‘Trust me to arrange things better than that!’ said Merry. ‘Wecan’t begin life at Crickhollow with a quarrel over baths. In that roomthere are three tubs, and a copper full of boiling water. There are alsotowels, mats and soap. Get inside, and be quick!’Merry and Fatty went into the kitchen on the other side of thepassage, and busied themselves with the final preparations for a latesupper. Snatches of competing songs came from the bathroom mixedwith the sound of splashing and wallowing. The voice of Pippinwas suddenly lifted up above the others in one of Bilbo’s favouritebath-songs.Sing hey! for the bath at close of daythat washes the weary mud away!A loon is he that will not sing:O! Water Hot is a noble thing!O! Sweet is the sound of falling rain,and the brook that leaps from hill to plain;but better than rain or rippling streamsis Water Hot that smokes and steams.O! Water cold we may pour at needdown a thirsty throat and be glad indeed;but better is Beer, if drink we lack,and Water Hot poured down the back.O! Water is fair that leaps on highin a fountain white beneath the sky;but never did fountain sound so sweetas splashing Hot Water with my feet!There was a terrific splash, and a shout of Whoa! from Frodo. Itappeared that a lot of Pippin’s bath had imitated a fountain andleaped on high.102 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSMerry went to the door: ‘What about supper and beer in thethroat?’ he called. Frodo came out drying his hair.‘There’s so much water in the air that I’m coming into the kitchento finish,’ he said.‘Lawks!’ said Merry, looking in. The stone floor was swimming.‘You ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat, Peregrin,’he said. ‘Hurry up, or we shan’t wait for you.’They had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire. ‘I supposeyou three won’t want mushrooms again?’ said Fredegar without muchhope.‘Yes we shall!’ cried Pippin.‘They’re mine!’ said Frodo. ‘Given to me by Mrs. Maggot, a queenamong farmers’ wives. Take your greedy hands away, and I’ll servethem.’Hobbits have a passion for mushrooms, surpassing even thegreediest likings of Big People. A fact which partly explains youngFrodo’s long expeditions to the renowned fields of the Marish, andthe wrath of the injured Maggot. On this occasion there was plentyfor all, even according to hobbit standards. There were also manyother things to follow, and when they had finished even Fatty Bolgerheaved a sigh of content. They pushed back the table, and drewchairs round the fire.‘We’ll clear up later,’ said Merry. ‘Now tell me all about it! Iguess that you have been having adventures, which was not quite fairwithout me. I want a full account; and most of all I want to knowwhat was the matter with old Maggot, and why he spoke to me likethat. He sounded almost as if he was scared, if that is possible.’‘We have all been scared,’ said Pippin after a pause, in whichFrodo stared at the fire and did not speak. ‘You would have been,too, if you had been chased for two days by Black Riders.’‘And what are they?’‘Black figures riding on black horses,’ answered Pippin. ‘If Frodowon’t talk, I will tell you the whole tale from the beginning.’ He thengave a full account of their journey from the time when they leftHobbiton. Sam gave various supporting nods and exclamations.Frodo remained silent.‘I should think you were making it all up,’ said Merry, ‘if I hadnot seen that black shape on the landing-stage – and heard the queersound in Maggot’s voice. What do you make of it all, Frodo?’‘Cousin Frodo has been very close,’ said Pippin. ‘But the time hascome for him to open out. So far we have been given nothing moreto go on than Farmer Maggot’s guess that it has something to dowith old Bilbo’s treasure.’A C O NSPI RA CY UNMAS K E D 103‘That was only a guess,’ said Frodo hastily. ‘Maggot does not knowanything.’‘Old Maggot is a shrewd fellow,’ said Merry. ‘A lot goes on behindhis round face that does not come out in his talk. I’ve heard that heused to go into the Old Forest at one time, and he has the reputationof knowing a good many strange things. But you can at least tell us,Frodo, whether you think his guess good or bad.’‘I think,’ answered Frodo slowly, ‘that it was a good guess, as faras it goes. There is a connexion with Bilbo’s old adventures, and theRiders are looking, or perhaps one ought to say searching, for him orfor me. I also fear, if you want to know, that it is no joke at all; andthat I am not safe here or anywhere else.’ He looked round at thewindows and walls, as if he was afraid they would suddenly give way.The others looked at him in silence, and exchanged meaning glancesamong themselves.‘It’s coming out in a minute,’ whispered Pippin to Merry. Merrynodded.‘Well!’ said Frodo at last, sitting up and straightening his back, asif he had made a decision. ‘I can’t keep it dark any longer. I havegot something to tell you all. But I don’t know quite how to begin.’‘I think I could help you,’ said Merry quietly, ‘by telling you someof it myself.’‘What do you mean?’ said Frodo, looking at him anxiously.‘Just this, my dear old Frodo: you are miserable, because you don’tknow how to say good-bye. You meant to leave the Shire, of course.But danger has come on you sooner than you expected, and nowyou are making up your mind to go at once. And you don’t want to.We are very sorry for you.’Frodo opened his mouth and shut it again. His look of surprisewas so comical that they laughed. ‘Dear old Frodo!’ said Pippin. ‘Didyou really think you had thrown dust in all our eyes? You have notbeen nearly careful or clever enough for that! You have obviouslybeen planning to go and saying farewell to all your haunts all thisyear since April. We have constantly heard you muttering: ‘‘Shall Iever look down into that valley again, I wonder’’, and things likethat. And pretending that you had come to the end of your money,and actually selling your beloved Bag End to those SackvilleBagginses! And all those close talks with Gandalf.’‘Good heavens!’ said Frodo. ‘I thought I had been both carefuland clever. I don’t know what Gandalf would say. Is all the Shirediscussing my departure then?’‘Oh no!’ said Merry. ‘Don’t worry about that! The secret won’tkeep for long, of course; but at present it is, I think, only known tous conspirators. After all, you must remember that we know you well,104 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSand are often with you. We can usually guess what you are thinking.I knew Bilbo, too. To tell you the truth, I have been watching yourather closely ever since he left. I thought you would go after himsooner or later; indeed I expected you to go sooner, and lately wehave been very anxious. We have been terrified that you might giveus the slip, and go off suddenly, all on your own like he did. Eversince this spring we have kept our eyes open, and done a good dealof planning on our own account. You are not going to escape soeasily!’‘But I must go,’ said Frodo. ‘It cannot be helped, dear friends. Itis wretched for us all, but it is no use your trying to keep me. Sinceyou have guessed so much, please help me and do not hinder me!’‘You do not understand!’ said Pippin. ‘You must go – and therefore we must, too. Merry and I are coming with you. Sam is anexcellent fellow, and would jump down a dragon’s throat to save you,if he did not trip over his own feet; but you will need more than onecompanion in your dangerous adventure.’‘My dear and most beloved hobbits!’said Frodo deeply moved. ‘ButI could not allow it. I decided that long ago, too. You speak of danger,but you do not understand. This is no treasure-hunt, no there-andback journey. I am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril.’‘Of course we understand,’ said Merry firmly. ‘That is why wehave decided to come. We know the Ring is no laughing-matter; butwe are going to do our best to help you against the Enemy.’‘The Ring!’ said Frodo, now completely amazed.‘Yes, the Ring,’ said Merry. ‘My dear old hobbit, you don’t allowfor the inquisitiveness of friends. I have known about the existenceof the Ring for years – before Bilbo went away, in fact; but since heobviously regarded it as secret, I kept the knowledge in my head,until we formed our conspiracy. I did not know Bilbo, of course, aswell as I know you; I was too young, and he was also more careful– but he was not careful enough. If you want to know how I firstfound out, I will tell you.’‘Go on!’ said Frodo faintly.‘It was the Sackville-Bagginses that were his downfall, as you mightexpect. One day, a year before the Party, I happened to be walkingalong the road, when I saw Bilbo ahead. Suddenly in the distancethe S.-B.s appeared, coming towards us. Bilbo slowed down, andthen hey presto! he vanished. I was so startled that I hardly had thewits to hide myself in a more ordinary fashion; but I got through thehedge and walked along the field inside. I was peeping through intothe road, after the S.-B.s had passed, and was looking straight atBilbo when he suddenly reappeared. I caught a glint of gold as heput something back in his trouser-pocket.A C O NSPI RA CY UNMAS K E D 105‘After that I kept my eyes open. In fact, I confess that I spied. Butyou must admit that it was very intriguing, and I was only in myteens. I must be the only one in the Shire, besides you Frodo, thathas ever seen the old fellow’s secret book.’‘You have read his book!’ cried Frodo. ‘Good heavens above! Isnothing safe?’‘Not too safe, I should say,’ said Merry. ‘But I have only had onerapid glance, and that was difficult to get. He never left the bookabout. I wonder what became of it. I should like another look. Haveyou got it, Frodo?’‘No. It was not at Bag End. He must have taken it away.’‘Well, as I was saying,’ Merry proceeded, ‘I kept my knowledgeto myself, till this spring when things got serious. Then we formedour conspiracy; and as we were serious, too, and meant business, wehave not been too scrupulous. You are not a very easy nut to crack,and Gandalf is worse. But if you want to be introduced to our chiefinvestigator, I can produce him.’‘Where is he?’ said Frodo, looking round, as if he expected amasked and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard.‘Step forward, Sam!’ said Merry; and Sam stood up with a facescarlet up to the ears. ‘Here’s our collector of information! And hecollected a lot, I can tell you, before he was finally caught. Afterwhich, I may say, he seemed to regard himself as on parole, anddried up.’‘Sam!’ cried Frodo, feeling that amazement could go no further,and quite unable to decide whether he felt angry, amused, relieved,or merely foolish.‘Yes, sir!’ said Sam. ‘Begging your pardon, sir! But I meant nowrong to you, Mr. Frodo, nor to Mr. Gandalf for that matter. Hehas some sense, mind you; and when you said go alone, he said no!take someone as you can trust.’‘But it does not seem that I can trust anyone,’ said Frodo.Sam looked at him unhappily. ‘It all depends on what you want,’put in Merry. ‘You can trust us to stick to you through thick andthin – to the bitter end. And you can trust us to keep any secret ofyours – closer than you keep it yourself. But you cannot trust us tolet you face trouble alone, and go off without a word. We are yourfriends, Frodo. Anyway: there it is. We know most of what Gandalfhas told you. We know a good deal about the Ring. We are horriblyafraid – but we are coming with you; or following you like hounds.’‘And after all, sir,’ added Sam, ‘you did ought to take the Elves’advice. Gildor said you should take them as was willing, and youcan’t deny it.’‘I don’t deny it,’ said Frodo, looking at Sam, who was now106 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSgrinning. ‘I don’t deny it, but I’ll never believe you are sleeping again,whether you snore or not. I shall kick you hard to make sure.‘You are a set of deceitful scoundrels!’ he said, turning to theothers. ‘But bless you!’ he laughed, getting up and waving his arms,‘I give in. I will take Gildor’s advice. If the danger were not so dark,I should dance for joy. Even so, I cannot help feeling happy; happierthan I have felt for a long time. I had dreaded this evening.’‘Good! That’s settled. Three cheers for Captain Frodo and company!’ they shouted; and they danced round him. Merry and Pippinbegan a song, which they had apparently got ready for the occasion.It was made on the model of the dwarf-song that started Bilbo onhis adventure long ago, and went to the same tune:Farewell we call to hearth and hall!Though wind may blow and rain may fall,We must away ere break of dayFar over wood and mountain tall.To Rivendell, where Elves yet dwellIn glades beneath the misty fell,Through moor and waste we ride in haste,And whither then we cannot tell.With foes ahead, behind us dread,Beneath the sky shall be our bed,Until at last our toil be passed,Our journey done, our errand sped.We must away! We must away!We ride before the break of day!‘Very good!’ said Frodo. ‘But in that case there are a lot of thingsto do before we go to bed – under a roof, for tonight at any rate.’‘Oh! That was poetry!’ said Pippin. ‘Do you really mean to startbefore the break of day?’‘I don’t know,’ answered Frodo. ‘I fear those Black Riders, andI am sure it is unsafe to stay in one place long, especially in a placeto which it is known I was going. Also Gildor advised me not towait. But I should very much like to see Gandalf. I could see thateven Gildor was disturbed when he heard that Gandalf had neverappeared. It really depends on two things. How soon could the Ridersget to Bucklebury? And how soon could we get off? It will take agood deal of preparation.’‘The answer to the second question,’ said Merry, ‘is that we couldA C O NSPI RA CY UNMAS K E D 107get off in an hour. I have prepared practically everything. There arefive ponies in a stable across the fields; stores and tackle are allpacked, except for a few extra clothes, and the perishable food.’‘It seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy,’ said Frodo.‘But what about the Black Riders? Would it be safe to wait one dayfor Gandalf?’‘That all depends on what you think the Riders would do, if theyfound you here,’ answered Merry. ‘They could have reached here bynow, of course, if they were not stopped at the North-gate, wherethe Hedge runs down to the river-bank, just this side of the Bridge.The gate-guards would not let them through by night, though theymight break through. Even in the daylight they would try to keepthem out, I think, at any rate until they got a message through tothe Master of the Hall – for they would not like the look of the Riders,and would certainly be frightened by them. But, of course, Bucklandcannot resist a determined attack for long. And it is possible that inthe morning even a Black Rider that rode up and asked for Mr.Baggins would be let through. It is pretty generally known that youare coming back to live at Crickhollow.’Frodo sat for a while in thought. ‘I have made up my mind,’ hesaid finally. ‘I am starting tomorrow, as soon as it is light. But I amnot going by road: it would be safer to wait here than that. If I gothrough the North-gate my departure from Buckland will be knownat once, instead of being secret for several days at least, as it might be.And what is more, the Bridge and the East Road near the borders willcertainly be watched, whether any Rider getsinto Buckland or not. Wedon’t know how many there are; but there are at least two, and possiblymore. The only thing to do isto go off in a quite unexpected direction.’‘But that can only mean going into the Old Forest!’ said Fredegarhorrified. ‘You can’t be thinking of doing that. It is quite as dangerousas Black Riders.’‘Not quite,’ said Merry. ‘It sounds very desperate, but I believeFrodo is right. It is the only way of getting off without being followedat once. With luck we might get a considerable start.’‘But you won’t have any luck in the Old Forest,’ objected Fredegar.‘No one ever hasluck in there. You’ll get lost. People don’t go in there.’‘Oh yes they do!’ said Merry. ‘The Brandybucks go in – occasionally when the fit takes them. We have a private entrance. Frodo wentin once, long ago. I have been in several times: usually in daylight,of course, when the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet.’‘Well, do as you think best!’ said Fredegar. ‘I am more afraid ofthe Old Forest than of anything I know about: the stories about itare a nightmare; but my vote hardly counts, as I am not going on108 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSthe journey. Still, I am very glad someone is stopping behind, whocan tell Gandalf what you have done, when he turns up, as I am surehe will before long.’Fond as he was of Frodo, Fatty Bolger had no desire to leavethe Shire, nor to see what lay outside it. His family came from theEastfarthing, from Budgeford in Bridgefields in fact, but he had neverbeen over the Brandywine Bridge. His task, according to the originalplans of the conspirators, was to stay behind and deal with inquisitivefolk, and to keep up as long as possible the pretence that Mr. Bagginswas still living at Crickhollow. He had even brought along some oldclothes of Frodo’s to help him in playing the part. They little thoughthow dangerous that part might prove.‘Excellent!’ said Frodo, when he understood the plan. ‘We couldnot have left any message behind for Gandalf otherwise. I don’t knowwhether these Riders can read or not, of course, but I should nothave dared to risk a written message, in case they got in and searchedthe house. But if Fatty is willing to hold the fort, and I can be sureof Gandalf knowing the way we have gone, that decides me. I amgoing into the Old Forest first thing tomorrow.’‘Well, that’s that,’ said Pippin. ‘On the whole I would rather haveour job than Fatty’s – waiting here till Black Riders come.’‘You wait till you are well inside the Forest,’ said Fredegar. ‘You’llwish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow.’‘It’s no good arguing about it any more,’ said Merry. ‘We havestill got to tidy up and put the finishing touches to the packing, beforewe get to bed. I shall call you all before the break of day.’When at last he had got to bed, Frodo could not sleep for sometime. His legs ached. He was glad that he was riding in the morning.Eventually he fell into a vague dream, in which he seemed to belooking out of a high window over a dark sea of tangled trees. Downbelow among the roots there was the sound of creatures crawlingand snuffling. He felt sure they would smell him out sooner or later.Then he heard a noise in the distance. At first he thought it wasa great wind coming over the leaves of the forest. Then he knew thatit was not leaves, but the sound of the Sea far-off; a sound he hadnever heard in waking life, though it had often troubled his dreams.Suddenly he found he was out in the open. There were no trees afterall. He was on a dark heath, and there was a strange salt smell in theair. Looking up he saw before him a tall white tower, standing aloneon a high ridge. A great desire came over him to climb the towerand see the Sea. He started to struggle up the ridge towards thetower: but suddenly a light came in the sky, and there was a noiseof thunder.Chapter 6THE OLD FORESTFrodo woke suddenly. It was still dark in the room. Merry was standing there with a candle in one hand, and banging on the door with theother. ‘All right! What is it?’ said Frodo, still shaken and bewildered.‘What is it!’ cried Merry. ‘It is time to get up. It is half past fourand very foggy. Come on! Sam is already getting breakfast ready.Even Pippin is up. I am just going to saddle the ponies, and fetchthe one that is to be the baggage-carrier. Wake that sluggard Fatty!At least he must get up and see us off.’Soon after six o’clock the five hobbits were ready to start. FattyBolger was still yawning. They stole quietly out of the house. Merrywent in front leading a laden pony, and took his way along a paththat went through a spinney behind the house, and then cut acrossseveral fields. The leaves of trees were glistening, and every twig wasdripping; the grass was grey with cold dew. Everything was still, andfar-away noises seemed near and clear: fowls chattering in a yard,someone closing a door of a distant house.In their shed they found the ponies: sturdy little beasts of the kindloved by hobbits, not speedy, but good for a long day’s work. Theymounted, and soon they were riding off into the mist, which seemedto open reluctantly before them and close forbiddingly behind them.After riding for about an hour, slowly and without talking, they sawthe Hedge looming suddenly ahead. It was tall and netted over withsilver cobwebs.‘How are you going to get through this?’ asked Fredegar.‘Follow me!’ said Merry, ‘and you will see.’ He turned to the leftalong the Hedge, and soon they came to a point where it bent inwards,running along the lip of a hollow. A cutting had been made, at somedistance from the Hedge, and went sloping gently down into theground. It had walls of brick at the sides, which rose steadily, untilsuddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel that dived deep underthe Hedge and came out in the hollow on the other side.Here Fatty Bolger halted. ‘Good-bye, Frodo!’ he said. ‘I wish youwere not going into the Forest. I only hope you will not need rescuing before the day is out. But good luck to you – today and everyday!’‘If there are no worse things ahead than the Old Forest, I shall belucky,’ said Frodo. ‘Tell Gandalf to hurry along the East Road: weshall soon be back on it and going as fast as we can.’ ‘Good-bye!’110 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSthey cried, and rode down the slope and disappeared from Fredegar’ssight into the tunnel.It was dark and damp. At the far end it was closed by a gate ofthick-set iron bars. Merry got down and unlocked the gate, and whenthey had all passed through he pushed it to again. It shut with aclang, and the lock clicked. The sound was ominous.‘There!’ said Merry. ‘You have left the Shire, and are now outside,and on the edge of the Old Forest.’‘Are the stories about it true?’ asked Pippin.‘I don’t know what stories you mean,’ Merry answered. ‘If youmean the old bogey-stories Fatty’s nurses used to tell him, aboutgoblins and wolves and things of that sort, I should say no. At anyrate I don’t believe them. But the Forest is queer. Everything in it isvery much more alive, more aware of what is going on, so to speak,than things are in the Shire. And the trees do not like strangers. Theywatch you. They are usually content merely to watch you, as long asdaylight lasts, and don’t do much. Occasionally the most unfriendlyones may drop a branch, or stick a root out, or grasp at you with along trailer. But at night things can be most alarming, or so I amtold. I have only once or twice been in here after dark, and then onlynear the hedge. I thought all the trees were whispering to each other,passing news and plots along in an unintelligible language; and thebranches swayed and groped without any wind. They do say the treesdo actually move, and can surround strangers and hem them in. Infact long ago they attacked the Hedge: they came and planted themselves right by it, and leaned over it. But the hobbits came and cutdown hundreds of trees, and made a great bonfire in the Forest, andburned all the ground in a long strip east of the Hedge. After thatthe trees gave up the attack, but they became very unfriendly. Thereis still a wide bare space not far inside where the bonfire was made.’‘Is it only the trees that are dangerous?’ asked Pippin.‘There are various queer things living deep in the Forest, and onthe far side,’ said Merry, ‘or at least I have heard so; but I have neverseen any of them. But something makes paths. Whenever one comesinside one finds open tracks; but they seem to shift and change fromtime to time in a queer fashion. Not far from this tunnel there is, orwas for a long time, the beginning of quite a broad path leading tothe Bonfire Glade, and then on more or less in our direction, eastand a little north. That is the path I am going to try and find.’The hobbits now left the tunnel-gate and rode across the widehollow. On the far side was a faint path leading up on to the floorof the Forest, a hundred yards and more beyond the Hedge; but itvanished assoon asit brought them underthe trees. Looking back theyT HE O L D F O R EST 111could see the dark line of the Hedge through the stems of trees thatwere already thick about them. Looking ahead they could see onlytree-trunks of innumerable sizes and shapes: straight or bent, twisted,leaning, squat or slender, smooth or gnarled and branched; and allthe stems were green or grey with moss and slimy, shaggy growths.Merry alone seemed fairly cheerful. ‘You had better lead on andfind that path,’ Frodo said to him. ‘Don’t let us lose one another, orforget which way the Hedge lies!’They picked a way among the trees, and their ponies ploddedalong, carefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing roots.There was no undergrowth. The ground was rising steadily, and asthey went forward it seemed that the trees became taller, darker, andthicker. There was no sound, except an occasional drip of moisturefalling through the still leaves. For the moment there was no whispering or movement among the branches; but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that they were being watched with disapproval, deepeningto dislike and even enmity. The feeling steadily grew, until they foundthemselves looking up quickly, or glancing back over their shoulders,as if they expected a sudden blow.There was not as yet any sign of a path, and the trees seemedconstantly to bar their way. Pippin suddenly felt that he could notbear it any longer, and without warning let out a shout. ‘Oi! Oi!’ hecried. ‘I am not going to do anything. Just let me pass through, willyou!’The others halted startled; but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavycurtain. There was no echo or answer though the wood seemed tobecome more crowded and more watchful than before.‘I should not shout, if I were you,’ said Merry. ‘It does more harmthan good.’Frodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through,and if he had been right to make the others come into this abominablewood. Merry was looking from side to side, and seemed alreadyuncertain which way to go. Pippin noticed it. ‘It has not taken youlong to lose us,’ he said. But at that moment Merry gave a whistleof relief and pointed ahead.‘Well, well!’ he said. ‘These trees do shift. There is the BonfireGlade in front of us (or I hope so), but the path to it seems to havemoved away!’The light grew clearer as they went forward. Suddenly they cameout of the trees and found themselves in a wide circular space. Therewas sky above them, blue and clear to their surprise, for down underthe Forest-roof they had not been able to see the rising morning andthe lifting of the mist. The sun was not, however, high enough yet112 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSto shine down into the clearing, though its light was on the tree-tops.The leaves were all thicker and greener about the edges of the glade,enclosing it with an almost solid wall. No tree grew there, only roughgrass and many tall plants: stalky and faded hemlocks and woodparsley, fire-weed seeding into fluffy ashes, and rampant nettles andthistles. A dreary place: but it seemed a charming and cheerful gardenafter the close Forest.The hobbits felt encouraged, and looked up hopefully at the broadening daylight in the sky. At the far side of the glade there was abreak in the wall of trees, and a clear path beyond it. They could seeit running on into the wood, wide in places and open above, thoughevery now and again the trees drew in and overshadowed it with theirdark boughs. Up this path they rode. They were still climbing gently,but they now went much quicker, and with better heart; for it seemedto them that the Forest had relented, and was going to let them passunhindered after all.But after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy. The treesdrew close again on either side, and they could no longer see farahead. Now stronger than ever they felt again the ill will of the woodpressing on them. So silent was it that the fall of their ponies’ hoofs,rustling on dead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden roots,seemed to thud in their ears. Frodo tried to sing a song to encouragethem, but his voice sank to a murmur.O! Wanderers in the shadowed landdespair not! For though dark they stand,all woods there be must end at last,and see the open sun go past:the setting sun, the rising sun,the day’s end, or the day begun.For east or west all woods must fail...Fail – even as he said the word his voice faded into silence. Theair seemed heavy and the making of words wearisome. Just behindthem a large branch fell from an old overhanging tree with a crashinto the path. The trees seemed to close in before them.‘They do not like all that about ending and failing,’ said Merry.‘I should not sing any more at present. Wait till we do get to theedge, and then we’ll turn and give them a rousing chorus!’He spoke cheerfully, and if he felt any great anxiety, he did notshow it. The others did not answer. They were depressed. A heavyweight was settling steadily on Frodo’s heart, and he regretted nowwith every step forward that he had ever thought of challenging themenace of the trees. He was, indeed, just about to stop and proposeT HE O L D F O R EST 113going back (if that was still possible), when things took a new turn.The path stopped climbing, and became for a while nearly level. Thedark trees drew aside, and ahead they could see the path going almoststraight forward. Before them, but some distance off, there stood agreen hill-top, treeless, rising like a bald head out of the encirclingwood. The path seemed to be making directly for it.They now hurried forward again, delighted with the thought ofclimbing out for a while above the roof of the Forest. The pathdipped, and then again began to climb upwards, leading them at lastto the foot of the steep hillside. There it left the trees and faded intothe turf. The wood stood all round the hill like thick hair that endedsharply in a circle round a shaven crown.The hobbits led their ponies up, winding round and round untilthey reached the top. There they stood and gazed about them. Theair was gleaming and sunlit, but hazy; and they could not see to anygreat distance. Near at hand the mist was now almost gone; thoughhere and there it lay in hollows of the wood, and to the south ofthem, out of a deep fold cutting right across the Forest, the fog stillrose like steam or wisps of white smoke.‘That,’ said Merry, pointing with his hand, ‘that is the line of theWithywindle. It comes down out of the Downs and flows south-westthrough the midst of the Forest to join the Brandywine belowHaysend. We don’t want to go that way! The Withywindle valley issaid to be the queerest part of the whole wood – the centre fromwhich all the queerness comes, as it were.’The others looked in the direction that Merry pointed out, butthey could see little but mists over the damp and deep-cut valley;and beyond it the southern half of the Forest faded from view.The sun on the hill-top was now getting hot. It must have beenabout eleven o’clock; but the autumn haze still prevented them fromseeing much in other directions. In the west they could not make outeither the line of the Hedge or the valley of the Brandywine beyondit. Northward, where they looked most hopefully, they could seenothing that might be the line of the great East Road, for which theywere making. They were on an island in a sea of trees, and the horizonwas veiled.On the south-eastern side the ground fell very steeply, as if theslopes of the hill were continued far down under the trees, like islandshores that really are the sides of a mountain rising out of deep waters.They sat on the green edge and looked out over the woods belowthem, while they ate their mid-day meal. As the sun rose and passednoon they glimpsed far off in the east the grey-green lines of theDowns that lay beyond the Old Forest on that side. That cheered114 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSthem greatly; for it was good to see a sight of anything beyond thewood’s borders, though they did not mean to go that way, if theycould help it: the Barrow-downs had as sinister a reputation in hobbitlegend as the Forest itself.At length they made up their minds to go on again. The path thathad brought them to the hill reappeared on the northward side; butthey had not followed it far before they became aware that it wasbending steadily to the right. Soon it began to descend rapidly andthey guessed that it must actually be heading towards the Withywindle valley: not at all the direction they wished to take. After somediscussion they decided to leave this misleading path and strike northward; for although they had not been able to see it from the hill-top,the Road must lie that way, and it could not be many miles off. Alsonorthward, and to the left of the path, the land seemed to be drierand more open, climbing up to slopes where the trees were thinner,and pines and firs replaced the oaks and ashes and other strange andnameless trees of the denser wood.At first their choice seemed to be good: they got along at a fairspeed, though whenever they got a glimpse of the sun in an openglade they seemed unaccountably to have veered eastwards. But aftera time the trees began to close in again, just where they had appearedfrom a distance to be thinner and less tangled. Then deep foldsin the ground were discovered unexpectedly, like the ruts of greatgiant-wheels or wide moats and sunken roads long disused andchoked with brambles. These lay usually right across their line ofmarch, and could only be crossed by scrambling down and out again,which was troublesome and difficult with their ponies. Each timethey climbed down they found the hollow filled with thick bushesand matted undergrowth, which somehow would not yield to theleft, but only gave way when they turned to the right; and they hadto go some distance along the bottom before they could find a wayup the further bank. Each time they clambered out, the trees seemeddeeper and darker; and always to the left and upwards it was mostdifficult to find a way, and they were forced to the right anddownwards.After an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direction,though they knew well enough that they had long ceased to go northward at all. They were being headed off, and were simply followinga course chosen for them – eastwards and southwards, into the heartof the Forest and not out of it.The afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled andstumbled into a fold that was wider and deeper than any they hadT HE O L D F O R EST 115yet met. It was so steep and overhung that it proved impossible toclimb out of it again, either forwards or backwards, without leavingtheir ponies and their baggage behind. All they could do was to followthe fold – downwards. The ground grew soft, and in places boggy;springs appeared in the banks, and soon they found themselves following a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy bed. Thenthe ground began to fall rapidly, and the brook growing strong andnoisy, flowed and leaped swiftly downhill. They were in a deep dim-litgully over-arched by trees high above them.After stumbling along for some way along the stream, they camequite suddenly out of the gloom. As if through a gate they saw thesunlight before them. Coming to the opening they found that theyhad made their way down through a cleft in a high steep bank, almosta cliff. At its feet was a wide space of grass and reeds; and in thedistance could be glimpsed another bank almost as steep. A goldenafternoon of late sunshine lay warm and drowsy upon the hiddenland between. In the midst of it there wound lazily a dark river ofbrown water, bordered with ancient willows, arched over with willows,blocked with fallen willows, and flecked with thousands of fadedwillow-leaves. The air was thick with them, fluttering yellow fromthe branches; for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing softlyin the valley, and the reeds were rustling, and the willow-boughs werecreaking.‘Well, now I have at least some notion of where we are!’ saidMerry. ‘We have come almost in the opposite direction to which weintended. This is the River Withywindle! I will go on and explore.’He passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the longgrasses. After a while he reappeared, and reported that there wasfairly solid ground between the cliff-foot and the river; in some placesfirm turf went down to the water’s edge. ‘What’s more,’ he said,‘there seems to be something like a footpath winding along on thisside of the river. If we turn left and follow it, we shall be bound tocome out on the east side of the Forest eventually.’‘I dare say!’ said Pippin. ‘That is, if the track goes on so far, anddoes not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there. Who madethe track, do you suppose, and why? I am sure it was not for ourbenefit. I am getting very suspicious of this Forest and everything init, and I begin to believe all the stories about it. And have you anyidea how far eastward we should have to go?’‘No,’ said Merry, ‘I haven’t. I don’t know in the least how fardown the Withywindle we are, or who could possibly come here oftenenough to make a path along it. But there is no other way out thatI can see or think of.’There being nothing else for it, they filed out, and Merry led them116 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSto the path that he had discovered. Everywhere the reeds and grasseswere lush and tall, in places far above their heads; but once found,the path was easy to follow, as it turned and twisted, picking out thesounder ground among the bogs and pools. Here and there it passedover other rills, running down gullies into the Withywindle out ofthe higher forest-lands, and at these points there were tree-trunks orbundles of brushwood laid carefully across.The hobbits began to feel very hot. There were armies of flies ofall kinds buzzing round their ears, and the afternoon sun was burningon their backs. At last they came suddenly into a thin shade; greatgrey branches reached across the path. Each step forward becamemore reluctant than the last. Sleepiness seemed to be creeping outof the ground and up their legs, and falling softly out of the air upontheir heads and eyes.Frodo felt his chin go down and his head nod. Just in front of himPippin fell forward on to his knees. Frodo halted. ‘It’s no good,’ heheard Merry saying. ‘Can’t go another step without rest. Must havenap. It’s cool under the willows. Less flies!’Frodo did not like the sound of this. ‘Come on!’ he cried. ‘Wecan’t have a nap yet. We must get clear of the Forest first.’ But theothers were too far gone to care. Beside them Sam stood yawningand blinking stupidly.Suddenly Frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him. His headswam. There now seemed hardly a sound in the air. The flies hadstopped buzzing. Only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing, a softfluttering as of a song half whispered, seemed to stir in the boughsabove. He lifted his heavy eyes and saw leaning over him a hugewillow-tree, old and hoary. Enormous it looked, its sprawlingbranches going up like reaching arms with many long-fingered hands,its knotted and twisted trunk gaping in wide fissures that creakedfaintly as the boughs moved. The leaves fluttering against the brightsky dazzled him, and he toppled over, lying where he fell upon thegrass.Merry and Pippin dragged themselves forward and lay down withtheir backs to the willow-trunk. Behind them the great cracks gapedwide to receive them as the tree swayed and creaked. They lookedup at the grey and yellow leaves, moving softly against the light, andsinging. They shut their eyes, and then it seemed that they couldalmost hear words, cool words, saying something about water andsleep. They gave themselves up to the spell and fell fast asleep at thefoot of the great grey willow.Frodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that was overpoweringhim; then with an effort he struggled to his feet again. He felt aT HE O L D F O R EST 117compelling desire for cool water. ‘Wait for me, Sam,’ he stammered.‘Must bathe feet a minute.’Half in a dream he wandered forward to the riverward side of thetree, where great winding roots grew out into the stream, like gnarleddragonets straining down to drink. He straddled one of these, andpaddled his hot feet in the cool brown water; and there he toosuddenly fell asleep with his back against the tree.Sam sat down and scratched his head, and yawned like a cavern.He was worried. The afternoon was getting late, and he thought thissudden sleepiness uncanny. ‘There’s more behind this than sun andwarm air,’ he muttered to himself. ‘I don’t like this great big tree. Idon’t trust it. Hark at it singing about sleep now! This won’t do atall!’He pulled himself to his feet, and staggered off to see what hadbecome of the ponies. He found that two had wandered on a goodway along the path; and he had just caught them and brought themback towards the others, when he heard two noises; one loud, andthe other soft but very clear. One was the splash of something heavyfalling into the water; the other was a noise like the snick of a lockwhen a door quietly closes fast.He rushed back to the bank. Frodo was in the water close to theedge, and a great tree-root seemed to be over him and holding himdown, but he was not struggling. Sam gripped him by the jacket, anddragged him from under the root; and then with difficulty hauledhim on to the bank. Almost at once he woke, and coughed andspluttered.‘Do you know, Sam,’ he said at length, ‘the beastly tree threw mein! I felt it. The big root just twisted round and tipped me in!’‘You were dreaming I expect, Mr. Frodo,’ said Sam. ‘Youshouldn’t sit in such a place, if you feel sleepy.’‘What about the others?’ Frodo asked. ‘I wonder what sort ofdreams they are having.’They went round to the other side of the tree, and then Samunderstood the click that he had heard. Pippin had vanished. Thecrack by which he had laid himself had closed together, so that nota chink could be seen. Merry was trapped: another crack had closedabout his waist; his legs lay outside, but the rest of him was inside adark opening, the edges of which gripped like a pair of pincers.Frodo and Sam beat first upon the tree-trunk where Pippin hadlain. They then struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the crackthat held poor Merry. It was quite useless.‘What a foul thing to happen!’ cried Frodo wildly. ‘Why did weever come into this dreadful Forest? I wish we were all back at118 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSCrickhollow!’ He kicked the tree with all his strength, heedless of hisown feet. A hardly perceptible shiver ran through the stem and upinto the branches; the leaves rustled and whispered, but with a soundnow of faint and far-off laughter.‘I suppose we haven’t got an axe among our luggage, Mr. Frodo?’asked Sam.‘I brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood,’ said Frodo. ‘Thatwouldn’t be much use.’‘Wait a minute!’ cried Sam, struck by an idea suggested by firewood. ‘We might do something with fire!’‘We might,’ said Frodo doubtfully. ‘We might succeed in roastingPippin alive inside.’‘We might try to hurt or frighten this tree to begin with,’ said Samfiercely. ‘If it don’t let them go, I’ll have it down, if I have to gnawit.’ He ran to the ponies and before long came back with two tinderboxes and a hatchet.Quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves, and bits of bark; andmade a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks. These they heapedagainst the trunk on the far side of the tree from the prisoners. Assoon as Sam had struck a spark into the tinder, it kindled the drygrass and a flurry of flame and smoke went up. The twigs crackled.Little fingers of fire licked against the dry scored rind of the ancienttree and scorched it. A tremor ran through the whole willow. Theleaves seemed to hiss above their heads with a sound of pain andanger. A loud scream came from Merry, and from far inside the treethey heard Pippin give a muffled yell.‘Put it out! Put it out!’ cried Merry. ‘He’ll squeeze me in two, ifyou don’t. He says so!’‘Who? What?’ shouted Frodo, rushing round to the other side ofthe tree.‘Put it out! Put it out!’ begged Merry. The branches of the willowbegan to sway violently. There was a sound as of a wind rising andspreading outwards to the branches of all the other trees round about,as though they had dropped a stone into the quiet slumber of theriver-valley and set up ripples of anger that ran out over the wholeForest. Sam kicked at the little fire and stamped out the sparks. ButFrodo, without any clear idea of why he did so, or what he hopedfor, ran along the path crying help! help! help! It seemed to him thathe could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill voice: it was blownaway from him by the willow-wind and drowned in a clamour ofleaves, as soon as the words left his mouth. He felt desperate: lostand witless.Suddenly he stopped. There was an answer, or so he thought; butit seemed to come from behind him, away down the path furtherT HE O L D F O R EST 119back in the Forest. He turned round and listened, and soon therecould be no doubt: someone was singing a song; a deep glad voicewas singing carelessly and happily, but it was singing nonsense:Hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo!Ring a dong! hop along! fal lal the willow!Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo!Half hopeful and half afraid of some new danger, Frodo and Samnow both stood still. Suddenly out of a long string of nonsense-words(or so they seemed) the voice rose up loud and clear and burst intothis song:Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My darling!Light goes the weather-wind and the feathered starling.Down along under Hill, shining in the sunlight,Waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight,There my pretty lady is, River-woman’s daughter,Slender as the willow-wand, clearer than the water.Old Tom Bombadil water-lilies bringingComes hopping home again. Can you hear him singing?Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! and merry-o,Goldberry, Goldberry, merry yellow berry-o!Poor old Willow-man, you tuck your roots away!Tom’s in a hurry now. Evening will follow day.Tom’s going home again water-lilies bringing.Hey! Come derry dol! Can you hear me singing?Frodo and Sam stood as if enchanted. The wind puffed out. Theleaves hung silently again on stiff branches. There was another burstof song, and then suddenly, hopping and dancing along the path,there appeared above the reeds an old battered hat with a tall crownand a long blue feather stuck in the band. With another hop and abound there came into view a man, or so it seemed. At any rate hewas too large and heavy for a hobbit, if not quite tall enough for oneof the Big People, though he made noise enough for one, stumpingalong with great yellow boots on his thick legs, and charging throughgrass and rushes like a cow going down to drink. He had a blue coatand a long brown beard; his eyes were blue and bright, and his facewas red as a ripe apple, but creased into a hundred wrinkles oflaughter. In his hands he carried on a large leaf as on a tray a smallpile of white water-lilies.‘Help!’ cried Frodo and Sam running towards him with their handsstretched out.120 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGS‘Whoa! Whoa! steady there!’ cried the old man, holding up onehand, and they stopped short, as if they had been struck stiff. ‘Now,my little fellows, where be you a-going to, puffing like a bellows?What’s the matter here then? Do you know who I am? I’m TomBombadil. Tell me what’s your trouble! Tom’s in a hurry now. Don’tyou crush my lilies!’‘My friends are caught in the willow-tree,’ cried Frodo breathlessly.‘Master Merry’s being squeezed in a crack!’ cried Sam.‘What?’ shouted Tom Bombadil, leaping up in the air. ‘Old ManWillow? Naught worse than that, eh? That can soon be mended. Iknow the tune for him. Old grey Willow-man! I’ll freeze his marrowcold, if he don’t behave himself. I’ll sing his roots off. I’ll sing a windup and blow leaf and branch away. Old Man Willow!’Setting down his lilies carefully on the grass, he ran to the tree.There he saw Merry’s feet still sticking out – the rest had alreadybeen drawn further inside. Tom put his mouth to the crack andbegan singing into it in a low voice. They could not catch thewords, but evidently Merry was aroused. His legs began to kick. Tomsprang away, and breaking off a hanging branch smote the side ofthe willow with it. ‘You let them out again, Old Man Willow!’ hesaid. ‘What be you a-thinking of? You should not be waking. Eatearth! Dig deep! Drink water! Go to sleep! Bombadil is talking!’ Hethen seized Merry’s feet and drew him out of the suddenly wideningcrack.There was a tearing creak and the other crack split open, and outof it Pippin sprang, as if he had been kicked. Then with a loud snapboth cracks closed fast again. A shudder ran through the tree fromroot to tip, and complete silence fell.‘Thank you!’ said the hobbits, one after the other.Tom Bombadil burst out laughing. ‘Well, my little fellows!’ saidhe, stooping so that he peered into their faces. ‘You shall come homewith me! The table is all laden with yellow cream, honeycomb, andwhite bread and butter. Goldberry is waiting. Time enough for questions around the supper table. You follow after me as quick as youare able!’ With that he picked up his lilies, and then with a beckoningwave of his hand went hopping and dancing along the path eastward,still singing loudly and nonsensically.Too surprised and too relieved to talk, the hobbits followed afterhim as fast as they could. But that was not fast enough. Tom soondisappeared in front of them, and the noise of his singing got fainterand further away. Suddenly his voice came floating back to them ina loud halloo!T HE O L D F O R EST 121Hop along, my little friends, up the Withywindle!Tom’s going on ahead candles for to kindle.Down west sinks the Sun: soon you will be groping.When the night-shadows fall, then the door will open,Out of the window-panes light will twinkle yellow.Fear no alder black! Heed no hoary willow!Fear neither root nor bough! Tom goes on before you.Hey now! merry dol! We’ll be waiting for you!After that the hobbits heard no more. Almost at once the sunseemed to sink into the trees behind them. They thought of theslanting light of evening glittering on the Brandywine River, and thewindows of Bucklebury beginning to gleam with hundreds of lights.Great shadows fell across them; trunks and branches of trees hungdark and threatening over the path. White mists began to rise andcurl on the surface of the river and stray about the roots of the treesupon its borders. Out of the very ground at their feet a shadowysteam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk.It became difficult to follow the path, and they were very tired.Their legs seemed leaden. Strange furtive noises ran among thebushes and reeds on either side of them; and if they looked up tothe pale sky, they caught sight of queer gnarled and knobbly facesthat gloomed dark against the twilight, and leered down at them fromthe high bank and the edges of the wood. They began to feel that allthis country was unreal, and that they were stumbling through anominous dream that led to no awakening.Just as they felt their feet slowing down to a standstill, they noticedthat the ground was gently rising. The water began to murmur. Inthe darkness they caught the white glimmer of foam, where the riverflowed over a short fall. Then suddenly the trees came to an end andthe mists were left behind. They stepped out from the Forest, andfound a wide sweep of grass welling up before them. The river, nowsmall and swift, was leaping merrily down to meet them, glintinghere and there in the light of the stars, which were already shiningin the sky.The grass under their feet was smooth and short, as if it had beenmown or shaven. The eaves of the Forest behind were clipped, andtrim as a hedge. The path was now plain before them, well-tendedand bordered with stone. It wound up on to the top of a grassy knoll,now grey under the pale starry night; and there, still high above themon a further slope, they saw the twinkling lights of a house. Downagain the path went, and then up again, up a long smooth hillsideof turf, towards the light. Suddenly a wide yellow beam flowed outbrightly from a door that was opened. There was Tom Bombadil’s122 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGShouse before them, up, down, under hill. Behind it a steep shoulderof the land lay grey and bare, and beyond that the dark shapes ofthe Barrow-downs stalked away into the eastern night.They all hurried forward, hobbits and ponies. Already half theirweariness and all their fears had fallen from them. Hey! Come merrydol! rolled out the song to greet them.Hey! Come derry dol! Hop along, my hearties!Hobbits! Ponies all! We are fond of parties.Now let the fun begin! Let us sing together!Then another clear voice, as young and as ancient as Spring, likethe song of a glad water flowing down into the night from a brightmorning in the hills, came falling like silver to meet them:Now let the song begin! Let us sing togetherOf sun, stars, moon and mist, rain and cloudy weather,Light on the budding leaf, dew on the feather,Wind on the open hill, bells on the heather,Reeds by the shady pool, lilies on the water:Old Tom Bombadil and the River-daughter!And with that song the hobbits stood upon the threshold, and agolden light was all about them.Chapter 7I N THE HOUSE O FTOM BOMBADILThe four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold, and stoodstill, blinking. They were in a long low room, filled with the light oflamps swinging from the beams of the roof; and on the table of darkpolished wood stood many candles, tall and yellow, burning brightly.In a chair, at the far side of the room facing the outer door, sat awoman. Her long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders; her gownwas green, green as young reeds, shot with silver like beads of dew;and her belt was of gold, shaped like a chain of flag-lilies set withthe pale-blue eyes of forget-me-nots. About her feet in wide vesselsof green and brown earthenware, white water-lilies were floating, sothat she seemed to be enthroned in the midst of a pool.‘Enter, good guests!’ she said, and as she spoke they knew that itwas her clear voice they had heard singing. They came a few timidsteps further into the room, and began to bow low, feeling strangelysurprised and awkward, like folk that, knocking at a cottage door tobeg for a drink of water, have been answered by a fair young elf-queenclad in living flowers. But before they could say anything, she spranglightly up and over the lily-bowls, and ran laughing towards them;and as she ran her gown rustled softly like the wind in the floweringborders of a river.‘Come dear folk!’ she said, taking Frodo by the hand. ‘Laugh andbe merry! I am Goldberry, daughter of the River.’ Then lightly shepassed them and closing the door she turned her back to it, with herwhite arms spread out across it. ‘Let us shut out the night!’ she said.‘For you are still afraid, perhaps, of mist and tree-shadows and deepwater, and untame things. Fear nothing! For tonight you are underthe roof of Tom Bombadil.’The hobbits looked at her in wonder; and she looked at each ofthem and smiled. ‘Fair lady Goldberry!’ said Frodo at last, feelinghis heart moved with a joy that he did not understand. He stood ashe had at times stood enchanted by fair elven-voices; but the spellthat was now laid upon him was different: less keen and lofty wasthe delight, but deeper and nearer to mortal heart; marvellous andyet not strange. ‘Fair lady Goldberry!’ he said again. ‘Now the joythat was hidden in the songs we heard is made plain to me.124 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSO slender as a willow-wand! O clearer than clear water!O reed by the living pool! Fair River-daughter!O spring-time and summer-time, and spring again after!O wind on the waterfall, and the leaves’ laughter!’Suddenly he stopped and stammered, overcome with surprise to hearhimself saying such things. But Goldberry laughed.‘Welcome!’ she said. ‘I had not heard that folk of the Shire wereso sweet-tongued. But I see that you are an Elf-friend; the light inyour eyes and the ring in your voice tells it. This is a merry meeting!Sit now, and wait for the Master of the house! He will not be long.He is tending your tired beasts.’The hobbits sat down gladly in low rush-seated chairs, while Goldberry busied herself about the table; and their eyes followed her, forthe slender grace of her movement filled them with quiet delight.From somewhere behind the house came the sound of singing. Everynow and again they caught, among many a derry dol and a merry doland a ring a ding dillo the repeated words:Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow;Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.‘Fair lady!’ said Frodo again after a while. ‘Tell me, if my askingdoes not seem foolish, who is Tom Bombadil?’‘He is,’ said Goldberry, staying her swift movements and smiling.Frodo looked at her questioningly. ‘He is, as you have seen him,’she said in answer to his look. ‘He is the Master of wood, water, andhill.’‘Then all this strange land belongs to him?’‘No indeed!’ she answered, and her smile faded. ‘That wouldindeed be a burden,’ she added in a low voice, as if to herself. ‘Thetrees and the grasses and all things growing or living in the landbelong each to themselves. Tom Bombadil is the Master. No onehas ever caught old Tom walking in the forest, wading in the water,leaping on the hill-tops under light and shadow. He has no fear. TomBombadil is master.’A door opened and in came Tom Bombadil. He had now no hatand his thick brown hair was crowned with autumn leaves. Helaughed, and going to Goldberry, took her hand.‘Here’s my pretty lady!’ he said, bowing to the hobbits. ‘Here’smy Goldberry clothed all in silver-green with flowers in her girdle!Is the table laden? I see yellow cream and honeycomb, and whitebread, and butter; milk, cheese, and green herbs and ripe berriesgathered. Is that enough for us? Is the supper ready?’I N T HE H OU SE O F T OM B OMBADI L 125‘It is,’ said Goldberry; ‘but the guests perhaps are not?’Tom clapped his hands and cried: ‘Tom, Tom! your guests aretired, and you had near forgotten! Come now, my merry friends, andTom will refresh you! You shall clean grimy hands, and wash yourweary faces; cast off your muddy cloaks and comb out your tangles!’He opened the door, and they followed him down a short passageand round a sharp turn. They came to a low room with a slopingroof (a penthouse, it seemed, built on to the north end of the house).Its walls were of clean stone, but they were mostly covered with greenhanging mats and yellow curtains. The floor was flagged, and strewnwith fresh green rushes. There were four deep mattresses, each piledwith white blankets, laid on the floor along one side. Against theopposite wall was a long bench laden with wide earthenware basins,and beside it stood brown ewers filled with water, some cold, somesteaming hot. There were soft green slippers set ready beside eachbed.Before long, washed and refreshed, the hobbits were seated at thetable, two on each side, while at either end sat Goldberry and theMaster. It was a long and merry meal. Though the hobbits ate, asonly famished hobbits can eat, there was no lack. The drink in theirdrinking-bowls seemed to be clear cold water, yet it went to theirhearts like wine and set free their voices. The guests became suddenlyaware that they were singing merrily, as if it was easier and morenatural than talking.At last Tom and Goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly. Theguests were commanded to sit quiet, and were set in chairs, eachwith a footstool to his tired feet. There was a fire in the wide hearthbefore them, and it was burning with a sweet smell, as if it were builtof apple-wood. When everything was set in order, all the lights inthe room were put out, except one lamp and a pair of candles ateach end of the chimney-shelf. Then Goldberry came and stoodbefore them, holding a candle; and she wished them each a goodnight and deep sleep.‘Have peace now,’ she said, ‘until the morning! Heed no nightlynoises! For nothing passes door and window here save moonlightand starlight and the wind off the hill-top. Good night!’ She passedout of the room with a glimmer and a rustle. The sound of herfootsteps was like a stream falling gently away downhill over coolstones in the quiet of night.Tom sat on a while beside them in silence, while each of themtried to muster the courage to ask one of the many questions he hadmeant to ask at supper. Sleep gathered on their eyelids. At last Frodospoke:126 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGS‘Did you hear me calling, Master, or was it just chance that broughtyou at that moment?’Tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream. ‘Eh, what?’said he. ‘Did I hear you calling? Nay, I did not hear: I was busysinging. Just chance brought me then, if chance you call it. It wasno plan of mine, though I was waiting for you. We heard news ofyou, and learned that you were wandering. We guessed you’d comeere long down to the water: all paths lead that way, down to Withywindle. Old grey Willow-man, he’s a mighty singer; and it’s hard forlittle folk to escape his cunning mazes. But Tom had an errand there,that he dared not hinder.’ Tom nodded as if sleep was taking himagain; but he went on in a soft singing voice:I had an errand there: gathering water-lilies,green leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady,the last ere the year’s end to keep them from the winter,to flower by her pretty feet till the snows are melted.Each year at summer’s end I go to find them for her,in a wide pool, deep and clear, far down Withywindle;there they open first in spring and there they linger latest.By that pool long ago I found the River-daughter,fair young Goldberry sitting in the rushes.Sweet was her singing then, and her heart was beating!He opened his eyes and looked at them with a sudden glint of blue:And that proved well for you – for now I shall no longergo down deep again along the forest-water,not while the year is old. Nor shall I be passingOld Man Willow’s house this side of spring-time,not till the merry spring, when the River-daughterdances down the withy-path to bathe in the water.He fell silent again; but Frodo could not help asking one morequestion: the one he most desired to have answered. ‘Tell us, Master,’he said, ‘about the Willow-man. What is he? I have never heard ofhim before.’‘No, don’t!’ said Merry and Pippin together, sitting suddenlyupright. ‘Not now! Not until the morning!’‘That is right!’ said the old man. ‘Now is the time for resting.Some things are ill to hear when the world’s in shadow. Sleep till themorning-light, rest on the pillow! Heed no nightly noise! Fear nogrey willow!’ And with that he took down the lamp and blew it out,and grasping a candle in either hand he led them out of the room.I N T HE H OU SE O F T OM B OMBADI L 127Their mattresses and pillows were soft as down, and the blanketswere of white wool. They had hardly laid themselves on the deepbeds and drawn the light covers over them before they were asleep.In the dead night, Frodo lay in a dream without light. Then hesaw the young moon rising; under its thin light there loomed beforehim a black wall of rock, pierced by a dark arch like a great gate. Itseemed to Frodo that he was lifted up, and passing over he saw thatthe rock-wall was a circle of hills, and that within it was a plain, andin the midst of the plain stood a pinnacle of stone, like a vast towerbut not made by hands. On its top stood the figure of a man. Themoon as it rose seemed to hang for a moment above his head andglistened in his white hair as the wind stirred it. Up from the darkplain below came the crying of fell voices, and the howling of manywolves. Suddenly a shadow, like the shape of great wings, passedacross the moon. The figure lifted his arms and a light flashed fromthe staff that he wielded. A mighty eagle swept down and bore himaway. The voices wailed and the wolves yammered. There was anoise like a strong wind blowing, and on it was borne the sound ofhoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping from the East. ‘Black Riders!’thought Frodo as he wakened, with the sound of the hoofs still echoing in his mind. He wondered if he would ever again have the courageto leave the safety of these stone walls. He lay motionless, still listening; but all was now silent, and at last he turned and fell asleep againor wandered into some other unremembered dream.At his side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; but a change cameover his dreams and he turned and groaned. Suddenly he woke, orthought he had waked, and yet still heard in the darkness the soundthat had disturbed his dream: tip-tap, squeak: the noise was likebranches fretting in the wind, twig-fingers scraping wall and window:creak, creak, creak. He wondered if there were willow-trees close tothe house; and then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he wasnot in an ordinary house at all, but inside the willow and listeningto that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him again. He sat up,and felt the soft pillows yield to his hands, and he lay down againrelieved. He seemed to hear the echo of words in his ears: ‘Fearnothing! Have peace until the morning! Heed no nightly noises!’Then he went to sleep again.It was the sound of water that Merry heard falling into his quietsleep: water streaming down gently, and then spreading, spreadingirresistibly all round the house into a dark shoreless pool. It gurgledunder the walls, and was rising slowly but surely. ‘I shall be drowned!’he thought. ‘It will find its way in, and then I shall drown.’ He feltthat he was lying in a soft slimy bog, and springing up he set his foot128 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSon the corner of a cold hard flagstone. Then he remembered wherehe was and lay down again. He seemed to hear or remember hearing:‘Nothing passes doors or windows save moonlight and starlight andthe wind off the hill-top.’ A little breath of sweet air moved thecurtain. He breathed deep and fell asleep again.As far as he could remember, Sam slept through the night in deepcontent, if logs are contented.They woke up, all four at once, in the morning light. Tom wasmoving about the room whistling like a starling. When he heard themstir he clapped his hands, and cried: ‘Hey! Come merry dol! derrydol! My hearties!’ He drew back the yellow curtains, and the hobbitssaw that these had covered the windows, at either end of the room,one looking east and the other looking west.They leapt up refreshed. Frodo ran to the eastern window, andfound himself looking into a kitchen-garden grey with dew. He hadhalf expected to see turf right up to the walls, turf all pocked withhoof-prints. Actually his view was screened by a tall line of beans onpoles; but above and far beyond them the grey top of the hill loomedup against the sunrise. It was a pale morning: in the East, behindlong clouds like lines of soiled wool stained red at the edges, layglimmering deeps of yellow. The sky spoke of rain to come; but thelight was broadening quickly, and the red flowers on the beans beganto glow against the wet green leaves.Pippin looked out of the western window, down into a pool ofmist. The Forest was hidden under a fog. It was like looking downon to a sloping cloud-roof from above. There was a fold or channelwhere the mist was broken into many plumes and billows: the valleyof the Withywindle. The stream ran down the hill on the left andvanished into the white shadows. Near at hand was a flower-gardenand a clipped hedge silver-netted, and beyond that grey shaven grasspale with dew-drops. There was no willow-tree to be seen.‘Good morning, merry friends!’ cried Tom, opening the easternwindow wide. A cool air flowed in; it had a rainy smell. ‘Sun won’tshow her face much today, I’m thinking. I have been walking wide,leaping on the hill-tops, since the grey dawn began, nosing wind andweather, wet grass underfoot, wet sky above me. I wakened Goldberrysinging under window; but naught wakes hobbit-folk in the earlymorning. In the night little folk wake up in the darkness, and sleepafter light has come! Ring a ding dillo! Wake now, my merry friends!Forget the nightly noises! Ring a ding dillo del! derry del, my hearties!If you come soon you’ll find breakfast on the table. If you come lateyou’ll get grass and rain-water!’Needless to say – not that Tom’s threat sounded very serious –I N T HE H OU SE O F T OM B OMBADI L 129the hobbits came soon, and left the table late and only when it wasbeginning to look rather empty. Neither Tom nor Goldberry werethere. Tom could be heard about the house, clattering in the kitchen,and up and down the stairs, and singing here and there outside. Theroom looked westward over the mist-clouded valley, and the windowwas open. Water dripped down from the thatched eaves above. Beforethey had finished breakfast the clouds had joined into an unbrokenroof, and a straight grey rain came softly and steadily down. Behindits deep curtain the Forest was completely veiled.As they looked out of the window there came falling gently as ifit was flowing down the rain out of the sky, the clear voice of Goldberry singing up above them. They could hear few words, but itseemed plain to them that the song was a rain-song, as sweet asshowers on dry hills, that told the tale of a river from the spring inthe highlands to the Sea far below. The hobbits listened with delight;and Frodo was glad in his heart, and blessed the kindly weather,because it delayed them from departing. The thought of going hadbeen heavy upon him from the moment he awoke; but he guessednow that they would not go further that day.The upper wind settled in the West and deeper and wetter cloudsrolled up to spill their laden rain on the bare heads of the Downs.Nothing could be seen all round the house but falling water. Frodostood near the open door and watched the white chalky path turninto a little river of milk and go bubbling away down into the valley.Tom Bombadil came trotting round the corner of the house, wavinghis arms as if he was warding off the rain – and indeed when hesprang over the threshold he seemed quite dry, except for his boots.These he took off and put in the chimney-corner. Then he sat in thelargest chair and called the hobbits to gather round him.‘This is Goldberry’s washing day,’ he said, ‘and her autumncleaning. Too wet for hobbit-folk – let them rest while they are able!It’s a good day for long tales, for questions and for answers, so Tomwill start the talking.’He then told them many remarkable stories, sometimes half as ifspeaking to himself, sometimes looking at them suddenly with abright blue eye under his deep brows. Often his voice would turn tosong, and he would get out of his chair and dance about. He toldthem tales of bees and flowers, the ways of trees, and the strangecreatures of the Forest, about the evil things and good things, thingsfriendly and things unfriendly, cruel things and kind things, andsecrets hidden under brambles.As they listened, they began to understand the lives of the Forest,apart from themselves, indeed to feel themselves as the strangers130 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSwhere all other things were at home. Moving constantly in and outof his talk was Old Man Willow, and Frodo learned now enough tocontent him, indeed more than enough, for it was not comfortablelore. Tom’s words laid bare the hearts of trees and their thoughts,which were often dark and strange, and filled with a hatred of thingsthat go free upon the earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning: destroyers and usurpers. It was not called the Old Forest withoutreason, for it was indeed ancient, a survivor of vast forgotten woods;and in it there lived yet, ageing no quicker than the hills, the fathersof the fathers of trees, remembering times when they were lords. Thecountless years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom, andwith malice. But none were more dangerous than the Great Willow:his heart was rotten, but his strength was green; and he was cunning,and a master of winds, and his song and thought ran through thewoods on both sides of the river. His grey thirsty spirit drew powerout of the earth and spread like fine root-threads in the ground, andinvisible twig-fingers in the air, till it had under its dominion nearlyall the trees of the Forest from the Hedge to the Downs.Suddenly Tom’s talk left the woods and went leaping up the youngstream, over bubbling waterfalls, over pebbles and worn rocks, andamong small flowers in close grass and wet crannies, wandering atlast up on to the Downs. They heard of the Great Barrows, and thegreen mounds, and the stone-rings upon the hills and in the hollowsamong the hills. Sheep were bleating in flocks. Green walls and whitewalls rose. There were fortresses on the heights. Kings of little kingdoms fought together, and the young Sun shone like fire on the redmetal of their new and greedy swords. There was victory and defeat;and towers fell, fortresses were burned, and flames went up into thesky. Gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and queens; andmounds covered them, and the stone doors were shut; and the grassgrew over all. Sheep walked for a while biting the grass, but soon thehills were empty again. A shadow came out of dark places far away,and the bones were stirred in the mounds. Barrow-wights walked inthe hollow places with a clink of rings on cold fingers, and gold chainsin the wind. Stone rings grinned out of the ground like broken teethin the moonlight.The hobbits shuddered. Even in the Shire the rumour of theBarrow-wights of the Barrow-downs beyond the Forest had beenheard. But it was not a tale that any hobbit liked to listen to, evenby a comfortable fireside far away. These four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this house had driven from their minds:the house of Tom Bombadil nestled under the very shoulder of thosedreaded hills. They lost the thread of his tale and shifted uneasily,looking aside at one another.I N T HE H OU SE O F T OM B OMBADI L 131When they caught his words again they found that he had nowwandered into strange regions beyond their memory and beyond theirwaking thought, into times when the world was wider, and the seasflowed straight to the western Shore; and still on and back Tom wentsinging out into ancient starlight, when only the Elf-sires were awake.Then suddenly he stopped, and they saw that he nodded as if he wasfalling asleep. The hobbits sat still before him, enchanted; and itseemed as if, under the spell of his words, the wind had gone, andthe clouds had dried up, and the day had been withdrawn, anddarkness had come from East and West, and all the sky was filledwith the light of white stars.Whether the morning and evening of one day or of many dayshad passed Frodo could not tell. He did not feel either hungry ortired, only filled with wonder. The stars shone through the windowand the silence of the heavens seemed to be round him. He spokeat last out of his wonder and a sudden fear of that silence:‘Who are you, Master?’ he asked.‘Eh, what?’ said Tom sitting up, and his eyes glinting in the gloom.‘Don’t you know my name yet? That’s the only answer. Tell me,who are you, alone, yourself and nameless? But you are young andI am old. Eldest, that’s what I am. Mark my words, my friends: Tomwas here before the river and the trees; Tom remembers the firstraindrop and the first acorn. He made paths before the Big People,and saw the little People arriving. He was here before the Kings andthe graves and the Barrow-wights. When the Elves passed westward,Tom was here already, before the seas were bent. He knew the darkunder the stars when it was fearless – before the Dark Lord camefrom Outside.’A shadow seemed to pass by the window, and the hobbits glancedhastily through the panes. When they turned again, Goldberry stoodin the door behind, framed in light. She held a candle, shielding itsflame from the draught with her hand; and the light flowed throughit, like sunlight through a white shell.‘The rain has ended,’ she said; ‘and new waters are running downhill, under the stars. Let us now laugh and be glad!’‘And let us have food and drink!’ cried Tom. ‘Long tales are thirsty.And long listening’s hungry work, morning, noon, and evening!’ Withthat he jumped out of his chair, and with a bound took a candle fromthe chimney-shelf and lit it in the flame that Goldberry held; thenhe danced about the table. Suddenly he hopped through the doorand disappeared.Quickly he returned, bearing a large and laden tray. Then Tomand Goldberry set the table; and the hobbits sat half in wonder andhalf in laughter: so fair was the grace of Goldberry and so merry and132 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSodd the caperings of Tom. Yet in some fashion they seemed to weavea single dance, neither hindering the other, in and out of the room,and round about the table; and with great speed food and vessels andlights were set in order. The boards blazed with candles, white andyellow. Tom bowed to his guests. ‘Supper is ready,’ said Goldberry;and now the hobbits saw that she was clothed all in silver with awhite girdle, and her shoes were like fishes’ mail. But Tom was allin clean blue, blue as rain-washed forget-me-nots, and he had greenstockings.It was a supper even better than before. The hobbits under thespell of Tom’s words may have missed one meal or many, but whenthe food was before them it seemed at least a week since they hadeaten. They did not sing or even speak much for a while, and paidclose attention to business. But after a time their hearts and spiritsrose high again, and their voices rang out in mirth and laughter.After they had eaten, Goldberry sang many songs for them, songsthat began merrily in the hills and fell softly down into silence; andin the silences they saw in their minds pools and waters wider thanany they had known, and looking into them they saw the sky belowthem and the stars like jewels in the depths. Then once more shewished them each good night and left them by the fireside. But Tomnow seemed wide awake and plied them with questions.He appeared already to know much about them and all theirfamilies, and indeed to know much of all the history and doings ofthe Shire down from days hardly remembered among the hobbitsthemselves. It no longer surprised them; but he made no secret thathe owed his recent knowledge largely to Farmer Maggot, whom heseemed to regard as a person of more importance than they hadimagined. ‘There’s earth under his old feet, and clay on his fingers;wisdom in his bones, and both his eyes are open,’ said Tom. It wasalso clear that Tom had dealings with the Elves, and it seemed thatin some fashion, news had reached him from Gildor concerning theflight of Frodo.Indeed so much did Tom know, and so cunning was his questioning, that Frodo found himself telling him more about Bilbo and hisown hopes and fears than he had told before even to Gandalf. Tomwagged his head up and down, and there was a glint in his eyes whenhe heard of the Riders.‘Show me the precious Ring!’ he said suddenly in the midst of thestory: and Frodo, to his own astonishment, drew out the chain fromhis pocket, and unfastening the Ring handed it at once to Tom.It seemed to grow larger as it lay for a moment on his big brownskinned hand. Then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed. ForI N T HE H OU SE O F T OM B OMBADI L 133a second the hobbits had a vision, both comical and alarming, of hisbright blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold. Then Tom put theRing round the end of his little finger and held it up to the candlelight.For a moment the hobbits noticed nothing strange about this. Thenthey gasped. There was no sign of Tom disappearing!Tom laughed again, and then he spun the Ring in the air – andit vanished with a flash. Frodo gave a cry – and Tom leaned forwardand handed it back to him with a smile.Frodo looked at it closely, and rather suspiciously (like one whohas lent a trinket to a juggler). It was the same Ring, or looked thesame and weighed the same: for that Ring had always seemed toFrodo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand. But something promptedhim to make sure. He was perhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom forseeming to make so light of what even Gandalf thought so perilouslyimportant. He waited for an opportunity, when the talk was goingagain, and Tom was telling an absurd story about badgers and theirqueer ways – then he slipped the Ring on.Merry turned towards him to say something and gave a start, andchecked an exclamation. Frodo was delighted (in a way): it was hisown ring all right, for Merry was staring blankly at his chair, andobviously could not see him. He got up and crept quietly away fromthe fireside towards the outer door.‘Hey there!’ cried Tom, glancing towards him with a most seeinglook in his shining eyes. ‘Hey! Come Frodo, there! Where be youa-going? Old Tom Bombadil’s not as blind as that yet. Take off yourgolden ring! Your hand’s more fair without it. Come back! Leaveyour game and sit down beside me! We must talk a while more, andthink about the morning. Tom must teach the right road, and keepyour feet from wandering.’Frodo laughed (trying to feel pleased), and taking off the Ring hecame and sat down again. Tom now told them that he reckoned theSun would shine tomorrow, and it would be a glad morning, andsetting out would be hopeful. But they would do well to start early;for weather in that country was a thing that even Tom could not besure of for long, and it would change sometimes quicker than hecould change his jacket. ‘I am no weather-master,’ said he; ‘nor isaught that goes on two legs.’By his advice they decided to make nearly due North from hishouse, over the western and lower slopes of the Downs: they mighthope in that way to strike the East Road in a day’s journey, and avoidthe Barrows. He told them not to be afraid – but to mind their ownbusiness.‘Keep to the green grass. Don’t you go a-meddling with old stoneor cold Wights or prying in their houses, unless you be strong folk134 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSwith hearts that never falter!’ He said this more than once; and headvised them to pass barrows by on the west-side, if they chancedto stray near one. Then he taught them a rhyme to sing, if theyshould by ill-luck fall into any danger or difficulty the next day.Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us!Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!When they had sung this altogether after him, he clapped themeach on the shoulder with a laugh, and taking candles led them backto their bedroom.Chapter 8FOG O N THE BARROW-DOWNSThat night they heard no noises. But either in his dreams or out ofthem, he could not tell which, Frodo heard a sweet singing runningin his mind: a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind agrey rain-curtain, and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glassand silver, until at last it was rolled back, and a far green countryopened before him under a swift sunrise.The vision melted into waking; and there was Tom whistling likea tree-full of birds; and the sun was already slanting down the hilland through the open window. Outside everything was green andpale gold.After breakfast, which they again ate alone, they made ready tosay farewell, as nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such a morning: cool, bright, and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin blue.The air came fresh from the North-west. Their quiet ponies werealmost frisky, sniffing and moving restlessly. Tom came out of thehouse and waved his hat and danced upon the doorstep, bidding thehobbits to get up and be off and go with good speed.They rode off along a path that wound away from behind thehouse, and went slanting up towards the north end of the hill-browunder which it sheltered. They had just dismounted to lead theirponies up the last steep slope, when suddenly Frodo stopped.‘Goldberry!’ he cried. ‘My fair lady, clad all in silver green! Wehave never said farewell to her, nor seen her since the evening!’ Hewas so distressed that he turned back; but at that moment a clearcall came rippling down. There on the hill-brow she stood beckoningto them: her hair was flying loose, and as it caught the sun it shoneand shimmered. A light like the glint of water on dewy grass flashedfrom under her feet as she danced.They hastened up the last slope, and stood breathless beside her.They bowed, but with a wave of her arm she bade them look round;and they looked out from the hill-top over lands under the morning.It was now as clear and far-seen as it had been veiled and misty whenthey stood upon the knoll in the Forest, which could now be seenrising pale and green out of the dark trees in the West. In thatdirection the land rose in wooded ridges, green, yellow, russet underthe sun, beyond which lay hidden the valley of the Brandywine. Tothe South, over the line of the Withywindle, there was a distant glintlike pale glass where the Brandywine River made a great loop in136 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSthe lowlands and flowed away out of the knowledge of the hobbits.Northward beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away in flatsand swellings of grey and green and pale earth-colours, until it fadedinto a featureless and shadowy distance. Eastward the Barrow-downsrose, ridge behind ridge into the morning, and vanished out of eyesight into a guess: it was no more than a guess of blue and a remotewhite glimmer blending with the hem of the sky, but it spoke tothem, out of memory and old tales, of the high and distant mountains.They took a deep draught of the air, and felt that a skip and afew stout strides would bear them wherever they wished. It seemedfainthearted to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the downstowards the Road, when they should be leaping, as lusty as Tom,over the stepping stones of the hills straight towards the Mountains.Goldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts.‘Speed now, fair guests!’ she said. ‘And hold to your purpose! Northwith the wind in the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps! Makehaste while the Sun shines!’ And to Frodo she said: ‘Farewell, Elffriend, it was a merry meeting!’But Frodo found no words to answer. He bowed low, and mountedhis pony, and followed by his friends jogged slowly down the gentleslope behind the hill. Tom Bombadil’s house and the valley, and theForest were lost to view. The air grew warmer between the greenwalls of hillside and hillside, and the scent of turf rose strong andsweet as they breathed. Turning back, when they reached the bottomof the green hollow, they saw Goldberry, now small and slender likea sunlit flower against the sky: she was standing still watching them,and her hands were stretched out towards them. As they looked shegave a clear call, and lifting up her hand she turned and vanishedbehind the hill.Their way wound along the floor of the hollow, and round thegreen feet of a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley, andthen over the shoulders of further hills, and down their long limbs,and up their smooth sides again, up on to new hill-tops and downinto new valleys. There was no tree nor any visible water: it was acountry of grass and short springy turf, silent except for the whisperof the air over the edges of the land, and high lonely cries of strangebirds. As they journeyed the sun mounted, and grew hot. Each timethey climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown less. Whenthey caught a glimpse of the country westward the distant Forestseemed to be smoking, as if the fallen rain was steaming up againfrom leaf and root and mould. A shadow now lay round the edge ofsight, a dark haze above which the upper sky was like a blue cap, hotand heavy.F OG ON T HE BARR OW-DOW NS 137About mid-day they came to a hill whose top was wide and flattened, like a shallow saucer with a green mounded rim. Inside therewas no air stirring, and the sky seemed near their heads. They rodeacross and looked northwards. Then their hearts rose; for it seemedplain that they had come further already than they had expected.Certainly the distances had now all become hazy and deceptive, butthere could be no doubt that the Downs were coming to an end. Along valley lay below them winding away northwards, until it cameto an opening between two steep shoulders. Beyond, there seemedto be no more hills. Due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark line.‘That is a line of trees,’ said Merry, ‘and that must mark the Road.All along it for many leagues east of the Bridge there are trees growing.Some say they were planted in the old days.’‘Splendid!’ said Frodo. ‘If we make as good going this afternoonas we have done this morning, we shall have left the Downs beforethe Sun sets and be jogging on in search of a camping place.’ Buteven as he spoke he turned his glance eastwards, and he saw that onthat side the hills were higher and looked down upon them; and allthose hills were crowned with green mounds, and on some werestanding stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of green gums.That view was somehow disquieting; so they turned from the sightand went down into the hollow circle. In the midst of it there stooda single stone, standing tall under the sun above, and at this hourcasting no shadow. It was shapeless and yet significant: like a landmark, or a guarding finger, or more like a warning. But they werenow hungry, and the sun was still at the fearless noon; so they settheir backs against the east side of the stone. It was cool, as if thesun had had no power to warm it; but at that time this seemedpleasant. There they took food and drink, and made as good a noonmeal under the open sky as anyone could wish; for the food camefrom ‘down under Hill’. Tom had provided them with plenty for thecomfort of the day. Their ponies unburdened strayed upon the grass.Riding over the hills, and eating their fill, the warm sun and thescent of turf, lying a little too long, stretching out their legs andlooking at the sky above their noses: these things are, perhaps, enoughto explain what happened. However that may be: they woke suddenlyand uncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant to take. Thestanding stone was cold, and it cast a long pale shadow that stretchedeastward over them. The sun, a pale and watery yellow, was gleamingthrough the mist just above the west wall of the hollow in which theylay; north, south, and east, beyond the wall the fog was thick, coldand white. The air was silent, heavy and chill. Their ponies werestanding crowded together with their heads down.138 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSThe hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm, and ran to the westernrim. They found that they were upon an island in the fog. Even asthey looked out in dismay towards the setting sun, it sank beforetheir eyes into a white sea, and a cold grey shadow sprang up in theEast behind. The fog rolled up to the walls and rose above them,and as it mounted it bent over their heads until it became a roof:they were shut in a hall of mist whose central pillar was the standingstone.They felt as if a trap was closing about them; but they did notquite lose heart. They still remembered the hopeful view they hadhad of the line of the Road ahead, and they still knew in whichdirection it lay. In any case, they now had so great a dislike for thathollow place about the stone that no thought of remaining there wasin their minds. They packed up as quickly as their chilled fingerswould work.Soon they were leading their ponies in single file over the rim anddown the long northward slope of the hill, down into a foggy sea. Asthey went down the mist became colder and damper, and their hairhung lank and dripping on their foreheads. When they reached thebottom it was so chill that they halted and got out cloaks and hoods,which soon became bedewed with grey drops. Then, mounting theirponies, they went slowly on again, feeling their way by the rise andfall of the ground. They were steering, as well as they could guess,for the gate-like opening at the far northward end of the long valleywhich they had seen in the morning. Once they were through thegap, they had only to keep on in anything like a straight line and theywere bound in the end to strike the Road. Their thoughts did not gobeyond that, except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyond theDowns there might be no fog.Their going was very slow. To prevent their getting separated andwandering in different directions they went in file, with Frodo leading.Sam was behind him, and after him came Pippin, and then Merry.The valley seemed to stretch on endlessly. Suddenly Frodo saw ahopeful sign. On either side ahead a darkness began to loom throughthe mist; and he guessed that they were at last approaching the gapin the hills, the north-gate of the Barrow-downs. If they could passthat, they would be free.‘Come on! Follow me!’ he called back over his shoulder, and hehurried forward. But his hope soon changed to bewilderment andalarm. The dark patches grew darker, but they shrank; and suddenlyhe saw, towering ominous before him and leaning slightly towardsone another like the pillars of a headless door, two huge standingstones. He could not remember having seen any sign of these in theF OG ON T HE BARR OW-DOW NS 139valley, when he looked out from the hill in the morning. He hadpassed between them almost before he was aware: and even as hedid so darkness seemed to fall round him. His pony reared andsnorted, and he fell off. When he looked back he found that he wasalone: the others had not followed him.‘Sam!’ he called. ‘Pippin! Merry! Come along! Why don’t youkeep up?’There was no answer. Fear took him, and he ran back past thestones shouting wildly: ‘Sam! Sam! Merry! Pippin!’ The pony boltedinto the mist and vanished. From some way off, or so it seemed, hethought he heard a cry: ‘Hoy! Frodo! Hoy!’ It was away eastward,on his left as he stood under the great stones, staring and straininginto the gloom. He plunged off in the direction of the call, and foundhimself going steeply uphill.As he struggled on he called again, and kept on calling more andmore frantically; but he heard no answer for some time, and then itseemed faint and far ahead and high above him. ‘Frodo! Hoy!’ camethe thin voices out of the mist: and then a cry that sounded like help,help! often repeated, ending with a last help! that trailed off into along wail suddenly cut short. He stumbled forward with all the speedhe could towards the cries; but the light was now gone, and clingingnight had closed about him, so that it was impossible to be sure ofany direction. He seemed all the time to be climbing up and up.Only the change in the level of the ground at his feet told himwhen he at last came to the top of a ridge or hill. He was weary,sweating and yet chilled. It was wholly dark.‘Where are you?’ he cried out miserably.There was no reply. He stood listening. He was suddenly awarethat it was getting very cold, and that up here a wind was beginningto blow, an icy wind. A change was coming in the weather. The mistwas flowing past him now in shreds and tatters. His breath wassmoking, and the darkness was less near and thick. He looked upand saw with surprise that faint stars were appearing overhead amidthe strands of hurrying cloud and fog. The wind began to hiss overthe grass.He imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry, and he madetowards it; and even as he went forward the mist was rolled up andthrust aside, and the starry sky was unveiled. A glance showed himthat he was now facing southwards and was on a round hill-top,which he must have climbed from the north. Out of the east thebiting wind was blowing. To his right there loomed against the westward stars a dark black shape. A great barrow stood there.‘Where are you?’ he cried again, both angry and afraid.140 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGS‘Here!’ said a voice, deep and cold, that seemed to come out ofthe ground. ‘I am waiting for you!’‘No!’ said Frodo; but he did not run away. His knees gave, andhe fell on the ground. Nothing happened, and there was no sound.Trembling he looked up, in time to see a tall dark figure like a shadowagainst the stars. It leaned over him. He thought there were two eyes,very cold though lit with a pale light that seemed to come from someremote distance. Then a grip stronger and colder than iron seizedhim. The icy touch froze his bones, and he remembered no more.When he came to himself again, for a moment he could recallnothing except a sense of dread. Then suddenly he knew that he wasimprisoned, caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow. A Barrow-wighthad taken him, and he was probably already under the dreadful spellsof the Barrow-wights about which whispered tales spoke. He darednot move, but lay as he found himself: flat on his back upon a coldstone with his hands on his breast.But though his fear was so great that it seemed to be part of thevery darkness that was round him, he found himself as he lay thinkingabout Bilbo Baggins and his stories, of their jogging along togetherin the lanes of the Shire and talking about roads and adventures.There is a seed of courage hidden (often deeply, it is true) in theheart of the fattest and most timid hobbit, waiting for some final anddesperate danger to make it grow. Frodo was neither very fat norvery timid; indeed, though he did not know it, Bilbo (and Gandalf)had thought him the best hobbit in the Shire. He thought he hadcome to the end of his adventure, and a terrible end, but the thoughthardened him. He found himself stiffening, as if for a final spring;he no longer felt limp like a helpless prey.As he lay there, thinking and getting a hold of himself, he noticedall at once that the darkness was slowly giving way: a pale greenishlight was growing round him. It did not at first show him what kindof a place he was in, for the light seemed to be coming out of himself,and from the floor beside him, and had not yet reached the roof orwall. He turned, and there in the cold glow he saw lying beside himSam, Pippin, and Merry. They were on their backs, and their faceslooked deathly pale; and they were clad in white. About them laymany treasures, of gold maybe, though in that light they looked coldand unlovely. On their heads were circlets, gold chains were abouttheir waists, and on their fingers were many rings. Swords lay bytheir sides, and shields were at their feet. But across their three neckslay one long naked sword.* * *F OG ON T HE BARR OW-DOW NS 141Suddenly a song began: a cold murmur, rising and falling. Thevoice seemed far away and immeasurably dreary, sometimes high inthe air and thin, sometimes like a low moan from the ground. Outof the formless stream of sad but horrible sounds, strings of wordswould now and again shape themselves: grim, hard, cold words,heartless and miserable. The night was railing against the morningof which it was bereaved, and the cold was cursing the warmth forwhich it hungered. Frodo was chilled to the marrow. After a whilethe song became clearer, and with dread in his heart he perceivedthat it had changed into an incantation:Cold be hand and heart and bone,and cold be sleep under stone:never more to wake on stony bed,never, till the Sun fails and the Moon is dead.In the black wind the stars shall die,and still on gold here let them lie,till the dark lord lifts his handover dead sea and withered land.He heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound. Raisinghimself on one arm he looked, and saw now in the pale light thatthey were in a kind of passage which behind them turned a corner.Round the corner a long arm was groping, walking on its fingerstowards Sam, who was lying nearest, and towards the hilt of thesword that lay upon him.At first Frodo felt as if he had indeed been turned into stone bythe incantation. Then a wild thought of escape came to him. Hewondered if he put on the Ring, whether the Barrow-wight wouldmiss him, and he might find some way out. He thought of himselfrunning free over the grass, grieving for Merry, and Sam, and Pippin,but free and alive himself. Gandalf would admit that there had beennothing else he could do.But the courage that had been awakened in him was now toostrong: he could not leave his friends so easily. He wavered, gropingin his pocket, and then fought with himself again; and as he did sothe arm crept nearer. Suddenly resolve hardened in him, and heseized a short sword that lay beside him, and kneeling he stoopedlow over the bodies of his companions. With what strength he hadhe hewed at the crawling arm near the wrist, and the hand broke off;but at the same moment the sword splintered up to the hilt. Therewas a shriek and the light vanished. In the dark there was a snarlingnoise.Frodo fell forward over Merry, and Merry’s face felt cold. All at142 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSonce back into his mind, from which it had disappeared with the firstcoming of the fog, came the memory of the house down under theHill, and of Tom singing. He remembered the rhyme that Tom hadtaught them. In a small desperate voice he began: Ho! Tom Bombadil!and with that name his voice seemed to grow strong: it had a fulland lively sound, and the dark chamber echoed as if to drum andtrumpet.Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us!Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!There was a sudden deep silence, in which Frodo could hear hisheart beating. After a long slow moment he heard plain, but far away,as if it was coming down through the ground or through thick walls,an answering voice singing:Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow,Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.None has ever caught him yet, for Tom, he is the master:His songs are stronger songs, and his feet are faster.There was a loud rumbling sound, as of stones rolling and falling,and suddenly light streamed in, real light, the plain light of day. Alow door-like opening appeared at the end of the chamber beyondFrodo’s feet; and there was Tom’s head (hat, feather, and all) framedagainst the light of the sun rising red behind him. The light fell uponthe floor, and upon the faces of the three hobbits lying beside Frodo.They did not stir, but the sickly hue had left them. They looked nowas if they were only very deeply asleep.Tom stooped, removed his hat, and came into the dark chamber,singing:Get out, you old Wight! Vanish in the sunlight!Shrivel like the cold mist, like the winds go wailing,Out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains!Come never here again! Leave your barrow empty!Lost and forgotten be, darker than the darkness,Where gates stand for ever shut, till the world is mended.At these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of thechamber fell in with a crash. Then there was a long trailing shriek,fading away into an unguessable distance; and after that silence.F OG ON T HE BARR OW-DOW NS 143‘Come, friend Frodo!’ said Tom. ‘Let us get out on to clean grass!You must help me bear them.’Together they carried out Merry, Pippin, and Sam. As Frodo leftthe barrow for the last time he thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still, like a wounded spider, in a heap of fallen earth. Tom wentback in again, and there was a sound of much thumping and stamping. When he came out he was bearing in his arms a great load oftreasure: things of gold, silver, copper, and bronze; many beads andchains and jewelled ornaments. He climbed the green barrow andlaid them all on top in the sunshine.There he stood, with his hat in his hand and the wind in his hair,and looked down upon the three hobbits, that had been laid on theirbacks upon the grass at the west side of the mound. Raising his righthand he said in a clear and commanding voice:Wake now my merry lads! Wake and hear me calling!Warm now be heart and limb! The cold stone is fallen;Dark door is standing wide; dead hand is broken.Night under Night is flown, and the Gate is open!To Frodo’s great joy the hobbits stirred, stretched their arms,rubbed their eyes, and then suddenly sprang up. They looked aboutin amazement, first at Frodo, and then at Tom standing large as lifeon the barrow-top above them; and then at themselves in their thinwhite rags, crowned and belted with pale gold, and jingling withtrinkets.‘What in the name of wonder?’ began Merry, feeling the goldencirclet that had slipped over one eye. Then he stopped, and a shadowcame over his face, and he closed his eyes. ‘Of course, I remember!’he said. ‘The men of Carn Duˆm came on us at night, and we wereworsted. Ah! the spear in my heart!’ He clutched at his breast. ‘No!No!’ he said, opening his eyes. ‘What am I saying? I have beendreaming. Where did you get to, Frodo?’‘I thought that I was lost,’ said Frodo; ‘but I don’t want to speakof it. Let us think of what we are to do now! Let us go on!’‘Dressed up like this, sir?’ said Sam. ‘Where are my clothes?’He flung his circlet, belt, and rings on the grass, and looked roundhelplessly, as if he expected to find his cloak, jacket, and breeches,and other hobbit-garments lying somewhere to hand.‘You won’t find your clothes again,’ said Tom, bounding downfrom the mound, and laughing as he danced round them in thesunlight. One would have thought that nothing dangerous or dreadfulhad happened; and indeed the horror faded out of their hearts asthey looked at him, and saw the merry glint in his eyes.144 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGS‘What do you mean?’ asked Pippin, looking at him, half puzzledand half amused. ‘Why not?’But Tom shook his head, saying: ‘You’ve found yourselves again,out of the deep water. Clothes are but little loss, if you escape fromdrowning. Be glad, my merry friends, and let the warm sunlight heatnow heart and limb! Cast off these cold rags! Run naked on the grass,while Tom goes a-hunting!’He sprang away down hill, whistling and calling. Looking downafter him Frodo saw him running away southwards along the greenhollow between their hill and the next, still whistling and crying:Hey! now! Come hoy now! Whither do you wander?Up, down, near or far, here, there or yonder?Sharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail and Bumpkin,White-socks my little lad, and old Fatty Lumpkin!So he sang, running fast, tossing up his hat and catching it, untilhe was hidden by a fold of the ground: but for some time his heynow! hoy now! came floating back down the wind, which had shiftedround towards the south.The air was growing very warm again. The hobbits ran about fora while on the grass, as he told them. Then they lay basking in thesun with the delight of those that have been wafted suddenly frombitter winter to a friendly clime, or of people that, after being longill and bedridden, wake one day to find that they are unexpectedlywell and the day is again full of promise.By the time that Tom returned they were feeling strong (andhungry). He reappeared, hat first, over the brow of the hill, and behind him came in an obedient line six ponies: their own five and onemore. The last was plainly old Fatty Lumpkin: he was larger, stronger,fatter (and older) than their own ponies. Merry, to whom the othersbelonged, had not, in fact, given them any such names, but theyanswered to the new names that Tom had given them for the rest oftheir lives. Tom called them one by one and they climbed over thebrow and stood in a line. Then Tom bowed to the hobbits.‘Here are your ponies, now!’ he said. ‘They’ve more sense (insome ways) than you wandering hobbits have – more sense in theirnoses. For they sniff danger ahead which you walk right into; and ifthey run to save themselves, then they run the right way. You mustforgive them all; for though their hearts are faithful, to face fear ofBarrow-wights is not what they were made for. See, here they comeagain, bringing all their burdens!’Merry, Sam, and Pippin now clothed themselves in spare garmentsF OG ON T HE BARR OW-DOW NS 145from their packs; and they soon felt too hot, for they were obligedto put on some of the thicker and warmer things that they had broughtagainst the oncoming of winter.‘Where does that other old animal, that Fatty Lumpkin, comefrom?’ asked Frodo.‘He’s mine,’ said Tom. ‘My four-legged friend; though I seldomride him, and he wanders often far, free upon the hillsides. Whenyour ponies stayed with me, they got to know my Lumpkin; and theysmelt him in the night, and quickly ran to meet him. I thought he’dlook for them and with his words of wisdom take all their fear away.But now, my jolly Lumpkin, old Tom’s going to ride. Hey! he’scoming with you, just to set you on the road; so he needs a pony.For you cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding, when you’re onyour own legs trying to trot beside them.’The hobbits were delighted to hear this, and thanked Tom manytimes; but he laughed, and said that they were so good at losingthemselves that he would not feel happy till he had seen them safeover the borders of his land. ‘I’ve got things to do,’ he said: ‘mymaking and my singing, my talking and my walking, and my watchingof the country. Tom can’t be always near to open doors and willowcracks. Tom has his house to mind, and Goldberry is waiting.’It was still fairly early by the sun, something between nine andten, and the hobbits turned their minds to food. Their last meal hadbeen lunch beside the standing stone the day before. They breakfastednow off the remainder of Tom’s provisions, meant for their supper,with additions that Tom had brought with him. It was not a largemeal (considering hobbits and the circumstances), but they felt muchbetter for it. While they were eating Tom went up to the mound,and looked through the treasures. Most of these he made into a pilethat glistered and sparkled on the grass. He bade them lie there ‘freeto all finders, birds, beasts, Elves or Men, and all kindly creatures’;for so the spell of the mound should be broken and scattered andno Wight ever come back to it. He chose for himself from the pile abrooch set with blue stones, many-shaded like flax-flowers or thewings of blue butterflies. He looked long at it, as if stirred by somememory, shaking his head, and saying at last:‘Here is a pretty toy for Tom and for his lady! Fair was she wholong ago wore this on her shoulder. Goldberry shall wear it now, andwe will not forget her!’For each of the hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf-shaped, andkeen, of marvellous workmanship, damasked with serpent-forms inred and gold. They gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths,wrought of some strange metal, light and strong, and set with many146 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSfiery stones. Whether by some virtue in these sheaths or because ofthe spell that lay on the mound, the blades seemed untouched bytime, unrusted, sharp, glittering in the sun.‘Old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit-people,’ he said.‘Sharp blades are good to have, if Shire-folk go walking, east, south,or far away into dark and danger.’ Then he told them that theseblades were forged many long years ago by Men of Westernesse: theywere foes of the Dark Lord, but they were overcome by the evil kingof Carn Duˆm in the Land of Angmar.‘Few now remember them,’ Tom murmured, ‘yet still some gowandering, sons of forgotten kings walking in loneliness, guardingfrom evil things folk that are heedless.’The hobbits did not understand his words, but as he spoke theyhad a vision as it were of a great expanse of years behind them, likea vast shadowy plain over which there strode shapes of Men, tall andgrim with bright swords, and last came one with a star on his brow.Then the vision faded, and they were back in the sunlit world. It wastime to start again. They made ready, packing their bags and ladingtheir ponies. Their new weapons they hung on their leather beltsunder their jackets, feeling them very awkward, and wondering ifthey would be of any use. Fighting had not before occurred to anyof them as one of the adventures in which their flight would landthem.At last they set off. They led their ponies down the hill; and thenmounting they trotted quickly along the valley. They looked backand saw the top of the old mound on the hill, and from it the sunlighton the gold went up like a yellow flame. Then they turned a shoulderof the Downs and it was hidden from view.Though Frodo looked about him on every side he saw no sign ofthe great stones standing like a gate, and before long they came tothe northern gap and rode swiftly through, and the land fell awaybefore them. It was a merry journey with Tom Bombadil trottinggaily beside them, or before them, on Fatty Lumpkin, who couldmove much faster than his girth promised. Tom sang most of thetime, but it was chiefly nonsense, or else perhaps a strange languageunknown to the hobbits, an ancient language whose words weremainly those of wonder and delight.They went forward steadily, but they soon saw that the Road wasfurther away than they had imagined. Even without a fog, their sleepat mid-day would have prevented them from reaching it until afternightfall on the day before. The dark line they had seen was not aline of trees but a line of bushes growing on the edge of a deep dikewith a steep wall on the further side. Tom said that it had once beenF OG ON T HE BARR OW-DOW NS 147the boundary of a kingdom, but a very long time ago. He seemed toremember something sad about it, and would not say much.They climbed down and out of the dike and through a gap in thewall, and then Tom turned due north, for they had been bearingsomewhat to the west. The land was now open and fairly level, andthey quickened their pace, but the sun was already sinking low whenat last they saw a line of tall trees ahead, and they knew that theyhad come back to the Road after many unexpected adventures. Theygalloped their ponies over the last furlongs, and halted under thelong shadows of the trees. They were on the top of a sloping bank,and the Road, now dim as evening drew on, wound away belowthem. At this point it ran nearly from South-west to North-east, andon their right it fell quickly down into a wide hollow. It was ruttedand bore many signs of the recent heavy rain; there were pools andpot-holes full of water.They rode down the bank and looked up and down. There wasnothing to be seen. ‘Well, here we are again at last!’ said Frodo. ‘Isuppose we haven’t lost more than two days by my short cut throughthe Forest! But perhaps the delay will prove useful – it may have putthem off our trail.’The others looked at him. The shadow of the fear of the BlackRiders came suddenly over them again. Ever since they had enteredthe Forest they had thought chiefly of getting back to the Road; onlynow when it lay beneath their feet did they remember the dangerwhich pursued them, and was more than likely to be lying in waitfor them upon the Road itself. They looked anxiously back towardsthe setting sun, but the Road was brown and empty.‘Do you think,’ asked Pippin hesitatingly, ‘do you think we maybe pursued, tonight?’‘No, I hope not tonight,’ answered Tom Bombadil; ‘nor perhapsthe next day. But do not trust my guess; for I cannot tell for certain.Out east my knowledge fails. Tom is not master of Riders from theBlack Land far beyond his country.’All the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them. Theyfelt that he would know how to deal with Black Riders, if anyonedid. They would soon now be going forward into lands wholly strangeto them, and beyond all but the most vague and distant legends ofthe Shire, and in the gathering twilight they longed for home. A deeploneliness and sense of loss was on them. They stood silent, reluctantto make the final parting, and only slowly became aware that Tomwas wishing them farewell, and telling them to have good heart andto ride on till dark without halting.‘Tom will give you good advice, till this day is over (after thatyour own luck must go with you and guide you): four miles along148 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSthe Road you’ll come upon a village, Bree under Bree-hill, with doorslooking westward. There you’ll find an old inn that is called ThePrancing Pony. Barliman Butterbur is the worthy keeper. There youcan stay the night, and afterwards the morning will speed you uponyour way. Be bold, but wary! Keep up your merry hearts, and rideto meet your fortune!’They begged him to come at least as far as the inn and drink oncemore with them; but he laughed and refused, saying:Tom’s country ends here: he will not pass the borders.Tom has his house to mind, and Goldberry is waiting!Then he turned, tossed up his hat, leaped on Lumpkin’s back, androde up over the bank and away singing into the dusk.The hobbits climbed up and watched him until he was out ofsight.‘I am sorry to take leave of Master Bombadil,’ said Sam. ‘He’s acaution and no mistake. I reckon we may go a good deal further andsee naught better, nor queerer. But I won’t deny I’ll be glad to seethis Prancing Pony he spoke of. I hope it’ll be like The Green Dragonaway back home! What sort of folk are they in Bree?’‘There are hobbits in Bree,’ said Merry, ‘as well as Big Folk. Idaresay it will be homelike enough. The Pony is a good inn by allaccounts. My people ride out there now and again.’‘It may be all we could wish,’ said Frodo; ‘but it is outside theShire all the same. Don’t make yourselves too much at home! Pleaseremember – all of you – that the name of Baggins must not bementioned. I am Mr. Underhill, if any name must be given.’They now mounted their ponies and rode off silently into theevening. Darkness came down quickly, as they plodded slowly downhill and up again, until at last they saw lights twinkling some distanceahead.Before them rose Bree-hill barring the way, a dark mass againstmisty stars; and under its western flank nestled a large village.Towards it they now hurried desiring only to find a fire, and a doorbetween them and the night.Chapter 9A T THE SIGN O F THEPRANCING PONYBree was the chief village of the Bree-land, a small inhabited region,like an island in the empty lands round about. Besides Bree itself,there was Staddle on the other side of the hill, Combe in a deepvalley a little further eastward, and Archet on the edge of the Chetwood. Lying round Bree-hill and the villages was a small country offields and tamed woodland only a few miles broad.The Men of Bree were brown-haired, broad, and rather short,cheerful and independent: they belonged to nobody but themselves;but they were more friendly and familiar with Hobbits, Dwarves,Elves, and other inhabitants of the world about them than was (oris) usual with Big People. According to their own tales they were theoriginal inhabitants and were the descendants of the first Men thatever wandered into the West of the middle-world. Few had survivedthe turmoils of the Elder Days; but when the Kings returned againover the Great Sea they had found the Bree-men still there, and theywere still there now, when the memory of the old Kings had fadedinto the grass.In those days no other Men had settled dwellings so far west, orwithin a hundred leagues of the Shire. But in the wild lands beyondBree there were mysterious wanderers. The Bree-folk called themRangers, and knew nothing of their origin. They were taller anddarker than the Men of Bree and were believed to have strange powersof sight and hearing, and to understand the languages of beasts andbirds. They roamed at will southwards, and eastwards even as far asthe Misty Mountains; but they were now few and rarely seen. Whenthey appeared they brought news from afar, and told strange forgottentales which were eagerly listened to; but the Bree-folk did not makefriends of them.There were also many families of hobbits in the Bree-land; andthey claimed to be the oldest settlement of Hobbits in the world, onethat was founded long before even the Brandywine was crossed andthe Shire colonized. They lived mostly in Staddle though there weresome in Bree itself, especially on the higher slopes of the hill, abovethe houses of the Men. The Big Folk and the Little Folk (as theycalled one another) were on friendly terms, minding their own affairsin their own ways, but both rightly regarding themselves as necessary150 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSparts of the Bree-folk. Nowhere else in the world was this peculiar(but excellent) arrangement to be found.The Bree-folk, Big and Little, did not themselves travel much;and the affairs of the four villages were their chief concern. Occasionally the Hobbits of Bree went as far as Buckland, or the Eastfarthing;but though their little land was not much further than a day’s ridingeast of the Brandywine Bridge, the Hobbits of the Shire now seldomvisited it. An occasional Bucklander or adventurous Took wouldcome out to the Inn for a night or two, but even that was becomingless and less usual. The Shire-hobbits referred to those of Bree, andto any others that lived beyond the borders, as Outsiders, and tookvery little interest in them, considering them dull and uncouth. Therewere probably many more Outsiders scattered about in the West ofthe World in those days than the people of the Shire imagined. Some,doubtless, were no better than tramps, ready to dig a hole in anybank and stay only as long as it suited them. But in the Bree-land,at any rate, the hobbits were decent and prosperous, and no morerustic than most of their distant relatives Inside. It was not yet forgotten that there had been a time when there was much coming andgoing between the Shire and Bree. There was Bree-blood in theBrandybucks by all accounts.The village of Bree had some hundred stone houses of the BigFolk, mostly above the Road, nestling on the hillside with windowslooking west. On that side, running in more than half a circle fromthe hill and back to it, there was a deep dike with a thick hedge onthe inner side. Over this the Road crossed by a causeway; but whereit pierced the hedge it was barred by a great gate. There was anothergate in the southern corner where the Road ran out of the village.The gates were closed at nightfall; but just inside them were smalllodges for the gatekeepers.Down on the Road, where it swept to the right to go round thefoot of the hill, there was a large inn. It had been built long ago whenthe traffic on the roads had been far greater. For Bree stood at anold meeting of ways; another ancient road crossed the East Road justoutside the dike at the western end of the village, and in former daysMen and other folk of various sorts had travelled much on it. Strangeas News from Bree was still a saying in the Eastfarthing, descendingfrom those days, when news from North, South, and East could beheard in the inn, and when the Shire-hobbits used to go more oftento hear it. But the Northern Lands had long been desolate, andthe North Road was now seldom used: it was grass-grown, and theBree-folk called it the Greenway.The Inn of Bree was still there, however, and the innkeeper wasA T T HE SIG N O F TH E PRAN CING P ON Y 151an important person. His house was a meeting place for the idle,talkative, and inquisitive among the inhabitants, large and small, ofthe four villages; and a resort of Rangers and other wanderers, andfor such travellers (mostly dwarves) as still journeyed on the EastRoad, to and from the Mountains.It was dark, and white stars were shining, when Frodo and hiscompanions came at last to the Greenway-crossing and drew nearthe village. They came to the West-gate and found it shut; but at thedoor of the lodge beyond it, there was a man sitting. He jumped upand fetched a lantern and looked over the gate at them in surprise.‘What do you want, and where do you come from?’ he askedgruffly.‘We are making for the inn here,’ answered Frodo. ‘We are journeying east and cannot go further tonight.’‘Hobbits! Four hobbits! And what’s more, out of the Shire by theirtalk,’ said the gatekeeper, softly as if speaking to himself. He staredat them darkly for a moment, and then slowly opened the gate andlet them ride through.‘We don’t often see Shire-folk riding on the Road at night,’ hewent on, as they halted a moment by his door. ‘You’ll pardon mywondering what business takes you away east of Bree! What mayyour names be, might I ask?’‘Our names and our business are our own, and this does not seema good place to discuss them,’ said Frodo, not liking the look of theman or the tone of his voice.‘Your business is your own, no doubt,’ said the man; ‘but it’s mybusiness to ask questions after nightfall.’‘We are hobbits from Buckland, and we have a fancy to travel andto stay at the inn here,’ put in Merry. ‘I am Mr. Brandybuck. Is thatenough for you? The Bree-folk used to be fair-spoken to travellers,or so I had heard.’‘All right, all right!’ said the man. ‘I meant no offence. But you’llfind maybe that more folk than old Harry at the gate will be askingyou questions. There’s queer folk about. If you go on to The Pony,you’ll find you’re not the only guests.’He wished them good night, and they said no more; but Frodocould see in the lantern-light that the man was still eyeing themcuriously. He was glad to hear the gate clang to behind them, as theyrode forward. He wondered why the man was so suspicious, andwhether anyone had been asking for news of a party of hobbits. Couldit have been Gandalf? He might have arrived, while they were delayedin the Forest and the Downs. But there was something in the lookand the voice of the gatekeeper that made him uneasy.152 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSThe man stared after the hobbits for a moment, and then he wentback to his house. As soon as his back was turned, a dark figureclimbed quickly in over the gate and melted into the shadows of thevillage street.The hobbits rode on up a gentle slope, passing a few detachedhouses, and drew up outside the inn. The houses looked large andstrange to them. Sam stared up at the inn with its three storeys andmany windows, and felt his heart sink. He had imagined himselfmeeting giants taller than trees, and other creatures even more terrifying, some time or other in the course of his journey; but at themoment he was finding his first sight of Men and their tall housesquite enough, indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring day. Hepictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows of theinn-yard, and Black Riders peering out of dark upper windows.‘We surely aren’t going to stay here for the night, are we, sir?’ heexclaimed. ‘If there are hobbit-folk in these parts, why don’t we lookfor some that would be willing to take us in? It would be morehomelike.’‘What’s wrong with the inn?’ said Frodo. ‘Tom Bombadil recommended it. I expect it’s homelike enough inside.’Even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiareyes. It had a front on the Road, and two wings running back onland partly cut out of the lower slopes of the hill, so that at the rearthe second-floor windows were level with the ground. There was awide arch leading to a courtyard between the two wings, and on theleft under the arch there was a large doorway reached by a few broadsteps. The door was open and light streamed out of it. Above thearch there was a lamp, and beneath it swung a large signboard: a fatwhite pony reared up on its hind legs. Over the door was painted inwhite letters: the prancing pony by barliman butterbur. Manyof the lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains.As they hesitated outside in the gloom, someone began singing amerry song inside, and many cheerful voices joined loudly in thechorus. They listened to this encouraging sound for a moment andthen got off their ponies. The song ended and there was a burst oflaughter and clapping.They led their ponies under the arch, and leaving them standingin the yard they climbed up the steps. Frodo went forward and nearlybumped into a short fat man with a bald head and a red face. Hehad a white apron on, and was bustling out of one door and inthrough another, carrying a tray laden with full mugs.‘Can we——’ began Frodo.‘Half a minute, if you please!’ shouted the man over his shoulder,A T T HE SIG N O F TH E PRAN CING P ON Y 153and vanished into a babel of voices and a cloud of smoke. In amoment he was out again, wiping his hands on his apron.‘Good evening, little master!’ he said, bending down. ‘What mayyou be wanting?’‘Beds for four, and stabling for five ponies, if that can be managed.Are you Mr. Butterbur?’‘That’s right! Barliman is my name. Barliman Butterbur at yourservice! You’re from the Shire, eh?’ he said, and then suddenly heclapped his hand to his forehead, as if trying to remember something.‘Hobbits!’ he cried. ‘Now what does that remind me of? Might I askyour names, sirs?’‘Mr. Took and Mr. Brandybuck,’ said Frodo; ‘and this is SamGamgee. My name is Underhill.’‘There now!’ said Mr. Butterbur, snapping his fingers. ‘It’s goneagain! But it’ll come back, when I have time to think. I’m run offmy feet; but I’ll see what I can do for you. We don’t often get a partyout of the Shire nowadays, and I should be sorry not to make youwelcome. But there is such a crowd already in the house tonight asthere hasn’t been for long enough. It never rains but it pours, we sayin Bree.’‘Hi! Nob!’ he shouted. ‘Where are you, you woolly-footed slowcoach? Nob!’‘Coming, sir! Coming!’ A cheery-looking hobbit bobbed out of adoor, and seeing the travellers, stopped short and stared at them withgreat interest.‘Where’s Bob?’ asked the landlord. ‘You don’t know? Well, findhim! Double sharp! I haven’t got six legs, nor six eyes neither! TellBob there’s five ponies that have to be stabled. He must find roomsomehow.’ Nob trotted off with a grin and a wink.‘Well now, what was I going to say?’ said Mr. Butterbur, tappinghis forehead. ‘One thing drives out another, so to speak. I’m thatbusy tonight, my head is going round. There’s a party that came upthe Greenway from down South last night – and that was strangeenough to begin with. Then there’s a travelling company of dwarvesgoing West come in this evening. And now there’s you. If you weren’thobbits, I doubt if we could house you. But we’ve got a room or twoin the north wing that were made special for hobbits, when this placewas built. On the ground floor as they usually prefer; round windowsand all as they like it. I hope you’ll be comfortable. You’ll be wantingsupper, I don’t doubt. As soon as may be. This way now!’He led them a short way down a passage, and opened a door.‘Here is a nice little parlour!’ he said. ‘I hope it will suit. Excuse menow. I’m that busy. No time for talking. I must be trotting. It’s hardwork for two legs, but I don’t get thinner. I’ll look in again later. If154 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSyou want anything, ring the hand-bell, and Nob will come. If hedon’t come, ring and shout!’Off he went at last, and left them feeling rather breathless. Heseemed capable of an endless stream of talk, however busy he mightbe. They found themselves in a small and cosy room. There was abit of bright fire burning on the hearth, and in front of it were somelow and comfortable chairs. There was a round table, already spreadwith a white cloth, and on it was a large hand-bell. But Nob, thehobbit servant, came bustling in long before they thought of ringing.He brought candles and a tray full of plates.‘Will you be wanting anything to drink, masters?’ he asked. ‘Andshall I show you the bedrooms, while your supper is got ready?’They were washed and in the middle of good deep mugs of beerwhen Mr. Butterbur and Nob came in again. In a twinkling the tablewaslaid. There was hotsoup, cold meats, a blackberry tart, new loaves,slabs of butter, and half a ripe cheese: good plain food, as good asthe Shire could show, and homelike enough to dispel the last of Sam’smisgivings (already much relieved by the excellence of the beer).The landlord hovered round for a little, and then prepared to leavethem. ‘I don’t know whether you would care to join the company,when you have supped,’ he said, standing at the door. ‘Perhaps youwould rather go to your beds. Still the company would be very pleasedto welcome you, if you had a mind. We don’t get Outsiders – travellersfrom the Shire, I should say, begging your pardon – often; and welike to hear a bit of news, or any story or song you may have in mind.But as you please! Ring the bell, if you lack anything!’So refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of theirsupper (about three quarters of an hour’s steady going, not hinderedby unnecessary talk) that Frodo, Pippin, and Sam decided to jointhe company. Merry said it would be too stuffy. ‘I shall sit herequietly by the fire for a bit, and perhaps go out later for a sniff ofthe air. Mind your Ps and Qs, and don’t forget that you are supposedto be escaping in secret, and are still on the high-road and not veryfar from the Shire!’‘All right!’ said Pippin. ‘Mind yourself! Don’t get lost, and don’tforget that it is safer indoors!’The company was in the big common-room of the inn. The gathering was large and mixed, as Frodo discovered, when his eyes gotused to the light. This came chiefly from a blazing log-fire, for thethree lamps hanging from the beams were dim, and half veiled insmoke. Barliman Butterbur was standing near the fire, talking to acouple of dwarves and one or two strange-looking men. On thebenches were various folk: men of Bree, a collection of local hobbitsA T T HE SIG N O F TH E PRAN CING P ON Y 155(sitting chattering together), a few more dwarves, and other vaguefigures difficult to make out away in the shadows and corners.As soon as the Shire-hobbits entered, there was a chorus of welcome from the Bree-landers. The strangers, especially those that hadcome up the Greenway, stared at them curiously. The landlord introduced the newcomers to the Bree-folk, so quickly that, though theycaught many names, they were seldom sure who the names belongedto. The Men of Bree seemed all to have rather botanical (and to theShire-folk rather odd) names, like Rushlight, Goatleaf, Heathertoes,Appledore, Thistlewool and Ferny (not to mention Butterbur). Someof the hobbits had similar names. The Mugworts, for instance,seemed numerous. But most of them had natural names, such asBanks, Brockhouse, Longholes, Sandheaver, and Tunnelly, many ofwhich were used in the Shire. There were several Underhills fromStaddle, and as they could not imagine sharing a name without beingrelated, they took Frodo to their hearts as a long-lost cousin.The Bree-hobbits were, in fact, friendly and inquisitive, and Frodosoon found that some explanation of what he was doing would haveto be given. He gave out that he was interested in history and geography (at which there was much wagging of heads, although neither ofthese words were much used in the Bree-dialect). He said he wasthinking of writing a book (at which there was silent astonishment),and that he and his friends wanted to collect information abouthobbits living outside the Shire, especially in the eastern lands.At this a chorus of voices broke out. If Frodo had really wantedto write a book, and had had many ears, he would have learnedenough for several chapters in a few minutes. And if that was notenough, he was given a whole list of names, beginning with ‘OldBarliman here’, to whom he could go for further information. Butafter a time, as Frodo did not show any sign of writing a book onthe spot, the hobbits returned to their questions about doings in theShire. Frodo did not prove very communicative, and he soon foundhimself sitting alone in a corner, listening and looking around.The Men and Dwarves were mostly talking of distant events andtelling news of a kind that was becoming only too familiar. Therewas trouble away in the South, and it seemed that the Men who hadcome up the Greenway were on the move, looking for lands wherethey could find some peace. The Bree-folk were sympathetic, butplainly not very ready to take a large number of strangers into theirlittle land. One of the travellers, a squint-eyed ill-favoured fellow,was foretelling that more and more people would be coming northin the near future. ‘If room isn’t found for them, they’ll find it forthemselves. They’ve a right to live, same as other folk,’ he said loudly.The local inhabitants did not look pleased at the prospect.156 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSThe hobbits did not pay much attention to all this, as it did notat the moment seem to concern hobbits. Big Folk could hardly begfor lodgings in hobbit-holes. They were more interested in Sam andPippin, who were now feeling quite at home, and were chatting gailyabout events in the Shire. Pippin roused a good deal of laughter withan account of the collapse of the roof of the Town Hole in MichelDelving: Will Whitfoot, the Mayor, and the fattest hobbit in theWestfarthing, had been buried in chalk, and came out like a floureddumpling. But there were several questions asked that made Frodoa little uneasy. One of the Bree-landers, who seemed to have beenin the Shire several times, wanted to know where the Underhills livedand who they were related to.Suddenly Frodo noticed that a strange-looking weather-beatenman, sitting in the shadows near the wall, was also listening intentlyto the hobbit-talk. He had a tall tankard in front of him, and wassmoking a long-stemmed pipe curiously carved. His legs werestretched out before him, showing high boots of supple leather thatfitted him well, but had seen much wear and were now caked withmud. A travel-stained cloak of heavy dark-green cloth was drawnclose about him, and in spite of the heat of the room he wore a hoodthat overshadowed his face; but the gleam of his eyes could be seenas he watched the hobbits.‘Who is that?’ Frodo asked, when he got a chance to whisper toMr. Butterbur. ‘I don’t think you introduced him?’‘Him?’ said the landlord in an answering whisper, cocking an eyewithout turning his head. ‘I don’t rightly know. He is one of thewandering folk – Rangers we call them. He seldom talks: not butwhat he can tell a rare tale when he has the mind. He disappears fora month, or a year, and then he pops up again. He was in and outpretty often last spring; but I haven’t seen him about lately. Whathis right name is I’ve never heard: but he’s known round here asStrider. Goes about at a great pace on his long shanks; though hedon’t tell nobody what cause he has to hurry. But there’s no accounting for East and West, as we say in Bree, meaning the Rangers andthe Shire-folk, begging your pardon. Funny you should ask abouthim.’ But at that moment Mr. Butterbur was called away by a demandfor more ale and his last remark remained unexplained.Frodo found that Strider was now looking at him, as if he hadheard or guessed all that had been said. Presently, with a wave of hishand and a nod, he invited Frodo to come over and sit by him. AsFrodo drew near he threw back his hood, showing a shaggy head ofdark hair flecked with grey, and in a pale stern face a pair of keengrey eyes.‘I am called Strider,’ he said in a low voice. ‘I am very pleasedA T T HE SIG N O F TH E PRAN CING P ON Y 157to meet you, Master – Underhill, if old Butterbur got your nameright.’‘He did,’ said Frodo stiffly. He felt far from comfortable underthe stare of those keen eyes.‘Well, Master Underhill,’ said Strider, ‘if I were you, I shouldstop your young friends from talking too much. Drink, fire, andchance-meeting are pleasant enough, but, well – this isn’t the Shire.There are queer folk about. Though I say it as shouldn’t, you maythink,’ he added with a wry smile, seeing Frodo’s glance. ‘And therehave been even stranger travellers through Bree lately,’ he went on,watching Frodo’s face.Frodo returned his gaze but said nothing; and Strider made nofurther sign. His attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on Pippin.To his alarm Frodo became aware that the ridiculous young Took,encouraged by his success with the fat Mayor of Michel Delving, wasnow actually giving a comic account of Bilbo’s farewell party. Hewas already giving an imitation of the Speech, and was drawing nearto the astonishing Disappearance.Frodo was annoyed. It was a harmless enough tale for most of thelocal hobbits, no doubt: just a funny story about those funny peopleaway beyond the River; but some (old Butterbur, for instance) knewa thing or two, and had probably heard rumours long ago aboutBilbo’s vanishing. It would bring the name of Baggins to their minds,especially if there had been inquiries in Bree after that name.Frodo fidgeted, wondering what to do. Pippin was evidently muchenjoying the attention he was getting, and had become quite forgetfulof their danger. Frodo had a sudden fear that in his present moodhe might even mention the Ring; and that might well be disastrous.‘You had better do something quick!’ whispered Strider in his ear.Frodo jumped up and stood on a table, and began to talk. Theattention of Pippin’s audience was disturbed. Some of the hobbitslooked at Frodo and laughed and clapped, thinking that Mr.Underhill had taken as much ale as was good for him.Frodo suddenly felt very foolish, and found himself (as was hishabit when making a speech) fingering the things in his pocket. Hefelt the Ring on its chain, and quite unaccountably the desire cameover him to slip it on and vanish out of the silly situation. It seemedto him, somehow, as if the suggestion came to him from outside,from someone or something in the room. He resisted the temptationfirmly, and clasped the Ring in his hand, as if to keep a hold on itand prevent it from escaping or doing any mischief. At any rate itgave him no inspiration. He spoke ‘a few suitable words’, as theywould have said in the Shire: We are all very much gratified by thekindness of your reception, and I venture to hope that my brief visit will158 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGShelp to renew the old ties of friendship between the Shire and Bree; andthen he hesitated and coughed.Everyone in the room was now looking at him. ‘A song!’ shoutedone of the hobbits. ‘A song! A song!’ shouted all the others. ‘Comeon now, master, sing us something that we haven’t heard before!’For a moment Frodo stood gaping. Then in desperation he begana ridiculous song that Bilbo had been rather fond of (and indeedrather proud of, for he had made up the words himself). It was aboutan inn; and that is probably why it came into Frodo’s mind justthen. Here it is in full. Only a few words of it are now, as a rule,remembered.There is an inn, a merry old innbeneath an old grey hill,And there they brew a beer so brownThat the Man in the Moon himself came downone night to drink his fill.The ostler has a tipsy catthat plays a five-stringed fiddle;And up and down he runs his bow,Now squeaking high, now purring low,now sawing in the middle.The landlord keeps a little dogthat is mighty fond of jokes;When there’s good cheer among the guests,He cocks an ear at all the jestsand laughs until he chokes.They also keep a horne´d cowas proud as any queen;But music turns her head like ale,And makes her wave her tufted tailand dance upon the green.And O! the rows of silver dishesand the store of silver spoons!For Sunday* there’s a special pair,And these they polish up with careon Saturday afternoons.* See note 2, III, p.1111A T THE SIGN O F THE PRANCING PONY 159The Man in the Moon was drinking deep,and the cat began to wail;A dish and a spoon on the table danced,The cow in the garden madly pranced,and the little dog chased his tail.The Man in the Moon took another mug,and then rolled beneath his chair;And there he dozed and dreamed of ale,Till in the sky the stars were pale,and dawn was in the air.Then the ostler said to his tipsy cat:‘The white horses of the Moon,They neigh and champ their silver bits;But their master’s been and drowned his wits,and the Sun’ll be rising soon!’So the cat on his fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle,a jig that would wake the dead:He squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune,While the landlord shook the Man in the Moon:‘It’s after three!’ he said.They rolled the Man slowly up the hilland bundled him into the Moon,While his horses galloped up in rear,And the cow came capering like a deer,and a dish ran up with the spoon.Now quicker the fiddle went deedle-dum-diddle;the dog began to roar,The cow and the horses stood on their heads;The guests all bounded from their bedsand danced upon the floor.With a ping and a pong the fiddle-strings broke!the cow jumped over the Moon,And the little dog laughed to see such fun,And the Saturday dish went off at a runwith the silver Sunday spoon.160 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSThe round Moon rolled behind the hillas the Sun raised up her head.She* hardly believed her fiery eyes;For though it was day, to her surprisethey all went back to bed!There was loud and long applause. Frodo had a good voice, andthe song tickled their fancy. ‘Where’s old Barley?’ they cried. ‘Heought to hear this. Bob ought to learn his cat the fiddle, and thenwe’d have a dance.’ They called for more ale, and began to shout:‘Let’s have it again, master! Come on now! Once more!’They made Frodo have another drink, and then begin his songagain, while many of them joined in; for the tune was well known,and they were quick at picking up words. It was now Frodo’s turnto feel pleased with himself. He capered about on the table; andwhen he came a second time to the cow jumped over the Moon, heleaped in the air. Much too vigorously; for he came down, bang, intoa tray full of mugs, and slipped, and rolled off the table with a crash,clatter, and bump! The audience all opened their mouths wide forlaughter, and stopped short in gaping silence; for the singer disappeared. He simply vanished, as if he had gone slap through thefloor without leaving a hole!The local hobbits stared in amazement, and then sprang to theirfeet and shouted for Barliman. All the company drew away fromPippin and Sam, who found themselves left alone in a corner, andeyed darkly and doubtfully from a distance. It was plain that manypeople regarded them now as the companions of a travelling magicianof unknown powers and purpose. But there was one swarthy Breelander, who stood looking at them with a knowing and half-mockingexpression that made them feel very uncomfortable. Presently heslipped out of the door, followed by the squint-eyed southerner: thetwo had been whispering together a good deal during the evening.Frodo felt a fool. Not knowing what else to do, he crawled awayunder the tables to the dark corner by Strider, who sat unmoved,giving no sign of his thoughts. Frodo leaned back against the walland took off the Ring. How it came to be on his finger he could nottell. He could only suppose that he had been handling it in his pocketwhile he sang, and that somehow it had slipped on when he stuckout his hand with a jerk to save his fall. For a moment he wonderedif the Ring itself had not played him a trick; perhaps it had tried toreveal itself in response to some wish or command that was felt inthe room. He did not like the looks of the men that had gone out.* Elves (and Hobbits) always refer to the Sun as She.A T T HE SIG N O F TH E PRAN CING P ON Y 161‘Well?’ said Strider, when he reappeared. ‘Why did you do that?Worse than anything your friends could have said! You have put yourfoot in it! Or should I say your finger?’‘I don’t know what you mean,’ said Frodo, annoyed and alarmed.‘Oh yes, you do,’ answered Strider; ‘but we had better wait untilthe uproar has died down. Then, if you please, Mr. Baggins, I shouldlike a quiet word with you.’‘What about?’ asked Frodo, ignoring the sudden use of his propername.‘A matter of some importance – to us both,’ answered Strider,looking Frodo in the eye. ‘You may hear something to youradvantage.’‘Very well,’ said Frodo, trying to appear unconcerned. ‘I’ll talk toyou later.’Meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace. Mr.Butterbur had come trotting in, and he was now trying to listen toseveral conflicting accounts of the event at the same time.‘I saw him, Mr. Butterbur,’ said a hobbit; ‘or leastways I didn’tsee him, if you take my meaning. He just vanished into thin air, ina manner of speaking.’‘You don’t say, Mr. Mugwort!’ said the landlord, looking puzzled.‘Yes I do!’ replied Mugwort. ‘And I mean what I say, what’s more.’‘There’s some mistake somewhere,’ said Butterbur, shaking hishead. ‘There was too much of that Mr. Underhill to go vanishinginto thin air; or into thick air, as is more likely in this room.’‘Well, where is he now?’ cried several voices.‘How should I know? He’s welcome to go where he will, so longas he pays in the morning. There’s Mr. Took, now: he’s not vanished.’‘Well, I saw what I saw, and I saw what I didn’t,’ said Mugwortobstinately.‘And I say there’s some mistake,’ repeated Butterbur, picking upthe tray and gathering up the broken crockery.‘Of course there’s a mistake!’ said Frodo. ‘I haven’t vanished. HereI am! I’ve just been having a few words with Strider in the corner.’He came forward into the firelight; but most of the companybacked away, even more perturbed than before. They were not inthe least satisfied by his explanation that he had crawled away quicklyunder the tables after he had fallen. Most of the Hobbits and theMen of Bree went off then and there in a huff, having no fancy forfurther entertainment that evening. One or two gave Frodo a blacklook and departed muttering among themselves. The Dwarves andthe two or three strange Men that still remained got up and saidgood night to the landlord, but not to Frodo and his friends. Before162 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSlong no one was left but Strider, who sat on, unnoticed, by the wall.Mr. Butterbur did not seem much put out. He reckoned, veryprobably, that his house would be full again on many future nights,until the present mystery had been thoroughly discussed. ‘Now whathave you been doing, Mr. Underhill?’ he asked. ‘Frightening mycustomers and breaking up my crocks with your acrobatics!’‘I am very sorry to have caused any trouble,’ said Frodo. ‘It wasquite unintentional, I assure you. A most unfortunate accident.’‘All right, Mr. Underhill! But if you’re going to do any moretumbling, or conjuring, or whatever it was, you’d best warn folkbeforehand – and warn me. We’re a bit suspicious round here ofanything out of the way – uncanny, if you understand me; and wedon’t take to it all of a sudden.’‘I shan’t be doing anything of the sort again, Mr. Butterbur, Ipromise you. And now I think I’ll be getting to bed. We shall bemaking an early start. Will you see that our ponies are ready by eighto’clock?’‘Very good! But before you go, I should like a word with you inprivate, Mr. Underhill. Something has just come back to my mindthat I ought to tell you. I hope that you’ll not take it amiss. WhenI’ve seen to a thing or two, I’ll come along to your room, if you’rewilling.’‘Certainly!’ said Frodo; but his heart sank. He wondered howmany private talks he would have before he got to bed, and whatthey would reveal. Were these people all in league against him? Hebegan to suspect even old Butterbur’s fat face of concealing darkdesigns.Chapter 10STRIDERFrodo, Pippin, and Sam made their way back to the parlour. Therewas no light. Merry was not there, and the fire had burned low. Itwas not until they had puffed up the embers into a blaze and thrownon a couple of faggots that they discovered Strider had come withthem. There he was calmly sitting in a chair by the door!‘Hallo!’ said Pippin. ‘Who are you, and what do you want?’‘I am called Strider,’ he answered; ‘and though he may have forgotten it, your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me.’‘You said I might hear something to my advantage, I believe,’ saidFrodo. ‘What have you to say?’‘Several things,’ answered Strider. ‘But, of course, I have my price.’‘What do you mean?’ asked Frodo sharply.‘Don’t be alarmed! I mean just this: I will tell you what I know,and give you some good advice – but I shall want a reward.’‘And what will that be, pray?’ said Frodo. He suspected now thathe had fallen in with a rascal, and he thought uncomfortably that hehad brought only a little money with him. All of it would hardlysatisfy a rogue, and he could not spare any of it.‘No more than you can afford,’ answered Strider with a slow smile,as if he guessed Frodo’s thoughts. ‘Just this: you must take me alongwith you, until I wish to leave you.’‘Oh, indeed!’ replied Frodo, surprised, but not much relieved.‘Even if I wanted another companion, I should not agree to any suchthing, until I knew a good deal more about you, and your business.’‘Excellent!’ exclaimed Strider, crossing his legs and sitting backcomfortably. ‘You seem to be coming to your senses again, and thatis all to the good. You have been much too careless so far. Very well!I will tell you what I know, and leave the reward to you. You maybe glad to grant it, when you have heard me.’‘Go on then!’ said Frodo. ‘What do you know?’‘Too much; too many dark things,’ said Strider grimly. ‘But asfor your business——’ He got up and went to the door, opened itquickly and looked out. Then he shut it quietly and sat down again.‘I have quick ears,’ he went on, lowering his voice, ‘and though Icannot disappear, I have hunted many wild and wary things and Ican usually avoid being seen, if I wish. Now, I was behind the hedgethis evening on the Road west of Bree, when four hobbits came outof the Downlands. I need not repeat all that they said to old Bombadil164 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSor to one another; but one thing interested me. Please remember, saidone of them, that the name Baggins must not be mentioned. I am Mr.Underhill, if any name must be given. That interested me so much thatI followed them here. I slipped over the gate just behind them. MaybeMr. Baggins has an honest reason for leaving his name behind; butif so, I should advise him and his friends to be more careful.’‘I don’t see what interest my name has for anyone in Bree,’ saidFrodo angrily, ‘and I have still to learn why it interests you. Mr.Strider may have an honest reason for spying and eavesdropping; butif so, I should advise him to explain it.’‘Well answered!’ said Strider laughing. ‘But the explanation issimple: I was looking for a Hobbit called Frodo Baggins. I wantedto find him quickly. I had learned that he was carrying out of theShire, well, a secret that concerned me and my friends.‘Now, don’t mistake me!’ he cried, as Frodo rose from his seat,and Sam jumped up with a scowl. ‘I shall take more care of the secretthan you do. And care is needed!’ He leaned forward and lookedat them. ‘Watch every shadow!’ he said in a low voice. ‘Black horsemen have passed through Bree. On Monday one came down theGreenway, they say; and another appeared later, coming up theGreenway from the south.’There was a silence. At last Frodo spoke to Pippin and Sam: ‘Iought to have guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us,’ hesaid. ‘And the landlord seems to have heard something. Why did hepress us to join the company? And why on earth did we behave sofoolishly: we ought to have stayed quiet in here.’‘It would have been better,’ said Strider. ‘I would have stoppedyour going into the common-room, if I could; but the innkeeperwould not let me in to see you, or take a message.’‘Do you think he——’ began Frodo.‘No, I don’t think any harm of old Butterbur. Only he does notaltogether like mysterious vagabonds of my sort.’ Frodo gave him apuzzled look. ‘Well, I have rather a rascally look, have I not?’ saidStrider with a curl of his lip and a queer gleam in his eye. ‘But Ihope we shall get to know one another better. When we do, I hopeyou will explain what happened at the end of your song. For thatlittle prank——’‘It was sheer accident!’ interrupted Frodo.‘I wonder,’ said Strider. ‘Accident, then. That accident has madeyour position dangerous.’‘Hardly more than it was already,’ said Frodo. ‘I knew these horsemen were pursuing me; but now at any rate they seem to have missedme and to have gone away.’S TR IDER 165‘You must not count on that!’ said Strider sharply. ‘They willreturn. And more are coming. There are others. I know their number.I know these Riders.’ He paused, and his eyes were cold and hard.‘And there are some folk in Bree who are not to be trusted,’ he wenton. ‘Bill Ferny, for instance. He has an evil name in the Bree-land,and queer folk call at his house. You must have noticed him amongthe company: a swarthy sneering fellow. He was very close with oneof the Southern strangers, and they slipped out together just afteryour ‘‘accident’’. Not all of those Southerners mean well; and asfor Ferny, he would sell anything to anybody; or make mischief foramusement.’‘What will Ferny sell, and what has my accident got to do withhim?’ said Frodo, still determined not to understand Strider’shints.‘News of you, of course,’ answered Strider. ‘An account of yourperformance would be very interesting to certain people. After thatthey would hardly need to be told your real name. It seems to meonly too likely that they will hear of it before this night is over. Isthat enough? You can do as you like about my reward: take me as aguide or not. But I may say that I know all the lands between theShire and the Misty Mountains, for I have wandered over them formany years. I am older than I look. I might prove useful. You willhave to leave the open road after tonight; for the horsemen will watchit night and day. You may escape from Bree, and be allowed to goforward while the Sun is up; but you won’t go far. They will comeon you in the wild, in some dark place where there is no help. Doyou wish them to find you? They are terrible!’The hobbits looked at him, and saw with surprise that his facewas drawn as if with pain, and his hands clenched the arms of hischair. The room was very quiet and still, and the light seemed tohave grown dim. For a while he sat with unseeing eyes as if walkingin distant memory or listening to sounds in the Night far away.‘There!’ he cried after a moment, drawing his hand across hisbrow. ‘Perhaps I know more about these pursuers than you do. Youfear them, but you do not fear them enough, yet. Tomorrow you willhave to escape, if you can. Strider can take you by paths that areseldom trodden. Will you have him?’There was a heavy silence. Frodo made no answer; his mind wasconfused with doubt and fear. Sam frowned, and looked at his master;and at last he broke out:‘With your leave, Mr. Frodo, I’d say no! This Strider here, hewarns and he says take care; and I say yes to that, and let’s beginwith him. He comes out of the Wild, and I never heard no good ofsuch folk. He knows something, that’s plain, and more than I like;166 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSbut it’s no reason why we should let him go leading us out into somedark place far from help, as he puts it.’Pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable. Strider did not replyto Sam, but turned his keen eyes on Frodo. Frodo caught his glanceand looked away. ‘No,’ he said slowly. ‘I don’t agree. I think, I thinkyou are not really as you choose to look. You began to talk to melike the Bree-folk, but your voice has changed. Still Sam seems rightin this: I don’t see why you should warn us to take care, and yet askus to take you on trust. Why the disguise? Who are you? What doyou really know about – about my business; and how do you knowit?’‘The lesson in caution has been well learned,’ said Strider with agrim smile. ‘But caution is one thing and wavering is another. Youwill never get to Rivendell now on your own, and to trust me isyour only chance. You must make up your mind. I will answersome of your questions, if that will help you to do so. But whyshould you believe my story, if you do not trust me already? Stillhere it is——’At that moment there came a knock at the door. Mr. Butterburhad arrived with candles, and behind him was Nob with cans of hotwater. Strider withdrew into a dark corner.‘I’ve come to bid you good night,’ said the landlord, putting thecandles on the table. ‘Nob! Take the water to the rooms!’ He camein and shut the door.‘It’s like this,’ he began, hesitating and looking troubled. ‘If I’vedone any harm, I’m sorry indeed. But one thing drives out another,as you’ll admit; and I’m a busy man. But first one thing and thenanother this week have jogged my memory, as the saying goes; andnot too late I hope. You see, I was asked to look out for hobbits ofthe Shire, and for one by the name of Baggins in particular.’‘And what has that got to do with me?’ asked Frodo.‘Ah! you know best,’ said the landlord, knowingly. ‘I won’t giveyou away; but I was told that this Baggins would be going by thename of Underhill, and I was given a description that fits you wellenough, if I may say so.’‘Indeed! Let’s have it then!’ said Frodo, unwisely interrupting.‘A stout little fellow with red cheeks,’ said Mr. Butterbur solemnly.Pippin chuckled, but Sam looked indignant. ‘That won’t help youmuch; it goes for most hobbits, Barley, he says to me,’ continued Mr.Butterbur with a glance at Pippin. ‘But this one is taller than some andfairer than most, and he has a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a brighteye. Begging your pardon, but he said it, not me.’‘He said it? And who was he?’ asked Frodo eagerly.S TR IDER 167‘Ah! That was Gandalf, if you know who I mean. A wizard theysay he is, but he’s a good friend of mine, whether or no. But now Idon’t know what he’ll have to say to me, if I see him again: turn allmy ale sour or me into a block of wood, I shouldn’t wonder. He’s abit hasty. Still what’s done can’t be undone.’‘Well, what have you done?’ said Frodo, getting impatient withthe slow unravelling of Butterbur’s thoughts.‘Where was I?’ said the landlord, pausing and snapping his fingers.‘Ah, yes! Old Gandalf. Three months back he walked right into myroom without a knock. Barley, he says, I’m off in the morning. Willyou do something for me? You’ve only to name it, I said. I’m in a hurry,said he, and I’ve no time myself, but I want a message took to the Shire.Have you anyone you can send, and trust to go? I can find someone, Isaid, tomorrow, maybe, or the day after. Make it tomorrow, he says, andthen he gave me a letter.‘It’s addressed plain enough,’ said Mr. Butterbur, producing aletter from his pocket, and reading out the address slowly and proudly(he valued his reputation as a lettered man):Mr. FRODO BAGGINS, BAG END, HOBBITON in the SHIRE.‘A letter for me from Gandalf!’ cried Frodo.‘Ah!’ said Mr. Butterbur. ‘Then your right name is Baggins?’‘It is,’ said Frodo, ‘and you had better give me that letter at once,and explain why you never sent it. That’s what you came to tellme, I suppose, though you’ve taken a long time to come to thepoint.’Poor Mr. Butterbur looked troubled. ‘You’re right, master,’ hesaid, ‘and I beg your pardon. And I’m mortal afraid of what Gandalfwill say, if harm comes of it. But I didn’t keep it back a-purpose. Iput it by safe. Then I couldn’t find nobody willing to go to the Shirenext day, nor the day after, and none of my own folk were to spare;and then one thing after another drove it out of my mind. I’m a busyman. I’ll do what I can to set matters right, and if there’s any helpI can give, you’ve only to name it.‘Leaving the letter aside, I promised Gandalf no less. Barley, hesays to me, this friend of mine from the Shire, he may be coming out thisway before long, him and another. He’ll be calling himself Underhill. Mindthat! But you need ask no questions. And if I’m not with him, he may bein trouble, and he may need help. Do whatever you can for him, and I’llbe grateful, he says. And here you are, and trouble is not far off,seemingly.’‘What do you mean?’ asked Frodo.‘These black men,’ said the landlord lowering his voice. ‘They’re168 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSlooking for Baggins, and if they mean well, then I’m a hobbit. It was onMonday, and all the dogs were yammering and the geese screaming.Uncanny, I called it. Nob, he came and told me that two black menwere at the door asking for a hobbit called Baggins. Nob’s hair wasall stood on end. I bid the black fellows be off, and slammed thedoor on them; but they’ve been asking the same question all the wayto Archet, I hear. And that Ranger, Strider, he’s been asking questions, too. Tried to get in here to see you, before you’d had bite orsup, he did.’‘He did!’ said Strider suddenly, coming forward into the light.‘And much trouble would have been saved, if you had let him in,Barliman.’The landlord jumped with surprise. ‘You!’ he cried. ‘You’re alwayspopping up. What do you want now?’‘He’s here with my leave,’ said Frodo. ‘He came to offer me hishelp.’‘Well, you know your own business, maybe,’ said Mr. Butterbur,looking suspiciously at Strider. ‘But if I was in your plight, I wouldn’ttake up with a Ranger.’‘Then who would you take up with?’ asked Strider. ‘A fat innkeeperwho only remembers his own name because people shout it at himall day? They cannot stay in The Pony for ever, and they cannot gohome. They have a long road before them. Will you go with themand keep the black men off?’‘Me? Leave Bree! I wouldn’t do that for any money,’ said Mr.Butterbur, looking really scared. ‘But why can’t you stay here quietfor a bit, Mr. Underhill? What are all these queer goings on? Whatare these black men after, and where do they come from, I’d like toknow?’‘I’m sorry I can’t explain it all,’ answered Frodo. ‘I am tired andvery worried, and it’s a long tale. But if you mean to help me, I oughtto warn you that you will be in danger as long as I am in your house.These Black Riders: I am not sure, but I think, I fear they comefrom——’‘They come from Mordor,’ said Strider in a low voice. ‘FromMordor, Barliman, if that means anything to you.’‘Save us!’ cried Mr. Butterbur turning pale; the name evidentlywas known to him. ‘That is the worst news that has come to Bree inmy time.’‘It is,’ said Frodo. ‘Are you still willing to help me?’‘I am,’ said Mr. Butterbur. ‘More than ever. Though I don’t knowwhat the likes of me can do against, against——’ he faltered.‘Against the Shadow in the East,’ said Strider quietly. ‘Not much,Barliman, but every little helps. You can let Mr. Underhill stay hereS TR IDER 169tonight, as Mr. Underhill; and you can forget the name of Baggins,till he is far away.’‘I’ll do that,’ said Butterbur. ‘But they’ll find out he’s here withouthelp from me, I’m afraid. It’s a pity Mr. Baggins drew attention tohimself this evening, to say no more. The story of that Mr. Bilbo’sgoing off has been heard before tonight in Bree. Even our Nob hasbeen doing some guessing in his slow pate; and there are others inBree quicker in the uptake than he is.’‘Well, we can only hope the Riders won’t come back yet,’ saidFrodo.‘I hope not, indeed,’ said Butterbur. ‘But spooks or no spooks,they won’t get in The Pony so easy. Don’t you worry till the morning.Nob’ll say no word. No black man shall pass my doors, while I canstand on my legs. Me and my folk’ll keep watch tonight; but youhad best get some sleep, if you can.’‘In any case we must be called at dawn,’ said Frodo. ‘We mustget off as early as possible. Breakfast at six-thirty, please.’‘Right! I’ll see to the orders,’ said the landlord. ‘Good night, Mr.Baggins – Underhill, I should say! Good night – now, bless me!Where’s your Mr. Brandybuck?’‘I don’t know,’ said Frodo with sudden anxiety. They had forgotten all about Merry, and it was getting late. ‘I am afraid he is out.He said something about going for a breath of air.’‘Well, you do want looking after and no mistake: your party mightbe on a holiday!’ said Butterbur. ‘I must go and bar the doors quick,but I’ll see your friend is let in when he comes. I’d better send Nobto look for him. Good night to you all!’ At last Mr. Butterbur wentout, with another doubtful look at Strider and a shake of his head.His footsteps retreated down the passage.‘Well?’ said Strider. ‘When are you going to open that letter?’Frodo looked carefully at the seal before he broke it. It seemed certainly to be Gandalf’s. Inside, written in the wizard’s strong butgraceful script, was the following message:THE PRANCING PONY, BREE. Midyear’s Day, Shire Year, 1418.Dear Frodo,Bad news has reached me here. I must go off at once. You had betterleave Bag End soon, and get out of the Shire before the end of July atlatest. I will return as soon as I can; and I will follow you, if I find thatyou are gone. Leave a message for me here, if you pass through Bree. Youcan trust the landlord (Butterbur). You may meet a friend of mine on theRoad: a Man, lean, dark, tall, by some called Strider. He knows our170 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSbusiness and will help you. Make for Rivendell. There I hope we may meetagain. If I do not come, Elrond will advise you.Yours in hasteGANDALF.PS. Do NOT use It again, not for any reason whatever! Do not travelby night!PPS. Make sure that it is the real Strider. There are many strange menon the roads. His true name is Aragorn.All that is gold does not glitter,Not all those who wander are lost;The old that is strong does not wither,Deep roots are not reached by the frost.From the ashes a fire shall be woken,A light from the shadows shall spring;Renewed shall be blade that was broken,The crownless again shall be king.PPPS. I hope Butterbur sends this promptly. A worthy man, but hismemory is like a lumber-room: thing wanted alwaysburied. If he forgets, I shall roast him.Fare Well!Frodo read the letter to himself, and then passed it to Pippin andSam. ‘Really old Butterbur has made a mess of things!’ he said. ‘Hedeserves roasting. If I had got this at once, we might all have beensafe in Rivendell by now. But what can have happened to Gandalf?He writes as if he was going into great danger.’‘He has been doing that for many years,’ said Strider.Frodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully, wondering aboutGandalf’s second postscript. ‘Why didn’t you tell me that you wereGandalf’s friend at once?’ he asked. ‘It would have saved time.’‘Would it? Would any of you have believed me till now?’ saidStrider. ‘I knew nothing of this letter. For all I knew I had to persuadeyou to trust me without proofs, if I was to help you. In any case, Idid not intend to tell you all about myself at once. I had to studyyou first, and make sure of you. The Enemy has set traps for mebefore now. As soon as I had made up my mind, I was ready to tellyou whatever you asked. But I must admit,’ he added with a queerlaugh, ‘that I hoped you would take to me for my own sake. A huntedman sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for friendship. But there,I believe my looks are against me.’‘They are – at first sight at any rate,’ laughed Pippin with suddenS TR IDER 171relief after reading Gandalf’s letter. ‘But handsome is as handsomedoes, as we say in the Shire; and I daresay we shall all look muchthe same after lying for days in hedges and ditches.’‘It would take more than a few days, or weeks, or years, of wandering in the Wild to make you look like Strider,’ he answered. ‘Andyou would die first, unless you are made of sterner stuff than youlook to be.’Pippin subsided; but Sam was not daunted, and he still eyedStrider dubiously. ‘How do we know you are the Strider that Gandalfspeaks about?’ he demanded. ‘You never mentioned Gandalf, till thisletter came out. You might be a play-acting spy, for all I can see,trying to get us to go with you. You might have done in the realStrider and took his clothes. What have you to say to that?’‘That you are a stout fellow,’ answered Strider; ‘but I am afraidmy only answer to you, Sam Gamgee, is this. If I had killed the realStrider, I could kill you. And I should have killed you already withoutso much talk. If I was after the Ring, I could have it – now!’He stood up, and seemed suddenly to grow taller. In his eyesgleamed a light, keen and commanding. Throwing back his cloak,he laid his hand on the hilt of a sword that had hung concealed byhis side. They did not dare to move. Sam sat wide-mouthed staringat him dumbly.‘But I am the real Strider, fortunately,’ he said, looking down atthem with his face softened by a sudden smile. ‘I am Aragorn son ofArathorn; and if by life or death I can save you, I will.’There was a long silence. At last Frodo spoke with hesitation. ‘Ibelieved that you were a friend before the letter came,’ he said, ‘orat least I wished to. You have frightened me several times tonight,but never in the way that servants of the Enemy would, or so Iimagine. I think one of his spies would – well, seem fairer and feelfouler, if you understand.’‘I see,’ laughed Strider. ‘I look foul and feel fair. Is that it? All thatis gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost.’‘Did the verses apply to you then?’ asked Frodo. ‘I could not makeout what they were about. But how did you know that they were inGandalf’s letter, if you have never seen it?’‘I did not know,’ he answered. ‘But I am Aragorn, and those versesgo with that name.’ He drew out his sword, and they saw that theblade was indeed broken a foot below the hilt. ‘Not much use is it,Sam?’ said Strider. ‘But the time is near when it shall be forgedanew.’Sam said nothing.‘Well,’ said Strider, ‘with Sam’s permission we will call that settled.172 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSStrider shall be your guide. And now I think it is time you went tobed and took what rest you can. We shall have a rough road tomorrow. Even if we are allowed to leave Bree unhindered, we canhardly hope now to leave it unnoticed. But I shall try to get lost assoon as possible. I know one or two ways out of Bree-land other thanthe main road. If once we shake off the pursuit, I shall make forWeathertop.’‘Weathertop?’ said Sam. ‘What’s that?’‘It is a hill, just to the north of the Road, about half way fromhere to Rivendell. It commands a wide view all round; and there weshall have a chance to look about us. Gandalf will make for thatpoint, if he follows us. After Weathertop our journey will becomemore difficult, and we shall have to choose between various dangers.’‘When did you last see Gandalf?’ asked Frodo. ‘Do you knowwhere he is, or what he is doing?’Strider looked grave. ‘I do not know,’ he said. ‘I came west withhim in the spring. I have often kept watch on the borders of the Shirein the last few years, when he was busy elsewhere. He seldom left itunguarded. We last met on the first of May: at Sarn Ford down theBrandywine. He told me that his business with you had gone well,and that you would be starting for Rivendell in the last week ofSeptember. As I knew he was at your side, I went away on a journeyof my own. And that has proved ill; for plainly some news reachedhim, and I was not at hand to help.‘I am troubled, for the first time since I have known him. Weshould have had messages, even if he could not come himself. WhenI returned, many days ago, I heard the ill news. The tidings had gonefar and wide that Gandalf was missing and the horsemen had beenseen. It was the Elven-folk of Gildor that told me this; and laterthey told me that you had left your home; but there was no newsof your leaving Buckland. I have been watching the East Roadanxiously.’‘Do you think the Black Riders have anything to do with it – withGandalf’s absence, I mean?’ asked Frodo.‘I do not know of anything else that could have hindered him,except the Enemy himself,’ said Strider. ‘But do not give up hope!Gandalf is greater than you Shire-folk know – as a rule you can onlysee his jokes and toys. But this business of ours will be his greatesttask.’Pippin yawned. ‘I am sorry,’ he said, ‘but I am dead tired. In spiteof all the danger and worry I must go to bed, or sleep where I sit.Where is that silly fellow, Merry? It would be the last straw, if wehad to go out in the dark to look for him.’* * *S TR IDER 173At that moment they heard a door slam; then feet came runningalong the passage. Merry came in with a rush followed by Nob. Heshut the door hastily, and leaned against it. He was out of breath.They stared at him in alarm for a moment before he gasped: ‘I haveseen them, Frodo! I have seen them! Black Riders!’‘Black Riders!’ cried Frodo. ‘Where?’‘Here. In the village. I stayed indoors for an hour. Then as youdid not come back, I went out for a stroll. I had come back againand was standing just outside the light of the lamp looking at thestars. Suddenly I shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping near: there was a sort of deeper shade among the shadows acrossthe road, just beyond the edge of the lamplight. It slid away at onceinto the dark without a sound. There was no horse.’‘Which way did it go?’ asked Strider, suddenly and sharply.Merry started, noticing the stranger for the first time. ‘Go on!’said Frodo. ‘This is a friend of Gandalf’s. I will explain later.’‘It seemed to make off up the Road, eastward,’ continued Merry.‘I tried to follow. Of course, it vanished almost at once; but I wentround the corner and on as far as the last house on the Road.’Strider looked at Merry with wonder. ‘You have a stout heart,’ hesaid; ‘but it was foolish.’‘I don’t know,’ said Merry. ‘Neither brave nor silly, I think. I couldhardly help myself. I seemed to be drawn somehow. Anyway, I went,and suddenly I heard voices by the hedge. One was muttering; andthe other was whispering, or hissing. I couldn’t hear a word that wassaid. I did not creep any closer, because I began to tremble all over.Then I felt terrified, and I turned back, and was just going to bolthome, when something came behind me and I...I fell over.’‘I found him, sir,’ put in Nob. ‘Mr. Butterbur sent me out witha lantern. I went down to West-gate, and then back up towardsSouth-gate. Just nigh Bill Ferny’s house I thought I could see something in the Road. I couldn’t swear to it, but it looked to me as iftwo men was stooping over something, lifting it. I gave a shout, butwhen I got up to the spot there was no signs of them, and only Mr.Brandybuck lying by the roadside. He seemed to be asleep. ‘‘I thoughtI had fallen into deep water,’’ he says to me, when I shook him. Veryqueer he was, and as soon as I had roused him, he got up and ranback here like a hare.’‘I am afraid that’s true,’ said Merry, ‘though I don’t know what Isaid. I had an ugly dream, which I can’t remember. I went to pieces.I don’t know what came over me.’‘I do,’ said Strider. ‘The Black Breath. The Riders must have lefttheir horses outside, and passed back through the South-gate insecret. They will know all the news now, for they have visited Bill174 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGSFerny; and probably that Southerner was a spy as well. Somethingmay happen in the night, before we leave Bree.’‘What will happen?’ said Merry. ‘Will they attack the inn?’‘No, I think not,’ said Strider. ‘They are not all here yet. And inany case that is not their way. In dark and loneliness they are strongest; they will not openly attack a house where there are lights andmany people – not until they are desperate, not while all the longleagues of Eriador still lie before us. But their power is in terror, andalready some in Bree are in their clutch. They will drive these wretchesto some evil work: Ferny, and some of the strangers, and, maybe,the gatekeeper too. They had words with Harry at West-gate onMonday. I was watching them. He was white and shaking when theyleft him.’‘We seem to have enemies all round,’ said Frodo. ‘What are weto do?’‘Stay here, and do not go to your rooms! They are sure to havefound out which those are. The hobbit-rooms have windows lookingnorth and close to the ground. We will all remain together and barthis window and the door. But first Nob and I will fetch your luggage.’While Strider was gone, Frodo gave Merry a rapid account ofall that had happened since supper. Merry was still reading andpondering Gandalf’s letter when Strider and Nob returned.‘Well Masters,’ said Nob, ‘I’ve ruffled up the clothes and put ina bolster down the middle of each bed. And I made a nice imitationof your head with a brown woollen mat, Mr. Bag – Underhill, sir,’he added with a grin.Pippin laughed. ‘Very life-like!’ he said. ‘But what will happenwhen they have penetrated the disguise?’‘We shall see,’ said Strider. ‘Let us hope to hold the fort tillmorning.’‘Good night to you,’ said Nob, and went off to take his part inthe watch on the doors.Their bags and gear they piled on the parlour-floor. They pusheda low chair against the door and shut the window. Peering out, Frodosaw that the night was still clear. The Sickle* was swinging brightabove the shoulders of Bree-hill. He then closed and barred the heavyinside shutters and drew the curtains together. Strider built up thefire and blew out all the candles.The hobbits lay down on their blankets with their feet towards thehearth; but Strider settled himself in the chair against the door. Theytalked for a little, for Merry still had several questions to ask.‘Jumped over the Moon!’ chuckled Merry as he rolled himself in* The Hobbits’ name for the Plough or Great Bear.S TR IDER 175his blanket. ‘Very ridiculous of you, Frodo! But I wish I had beenthere to see. The worthies of Bree will be discussing it a hundredyears hence.’‘I hope so,’ said Strider. Then they all fell silent, and one by onethe hobbits dropped off to sleep.Chapter 11A KNIFE I N THE DARKAs they prepared for sleep in the inn at Bree, darkness lay on Buckland; a mist strayed in the dells and along the river-bank. The houseat Crickhollow stood silent. Fatty Bolger opened the door cautiouslyand peered out. A feeling of fear had been growing on him all day,and he was unable to rest or go to bed: there was a brooding threatin the breathless night-air. As he stared out into the gloom, a blackshadow moved under the trees; the gate seemed to open of its ownaccord and close again without a sound. Terror seized him. He shrankback, and for a moment he stood trembling in the hall. Then he shutand locked the door.The night deepened. There came the soft sound of horses ledwith stealth along the lane. Outside the gate they stopped, and threeblack figures entered, like shades of night creeping across the ground.One went to the door, one to the corner of the house on either side;and there they stood, as still as the shadows of stones, while nightwent slowly on. The house and the quiet trees seemed to be waitingbreathlessly.There was a faint stir in the leaves, and a cock crowed far away.The cold hour before dawn was passing. The figure by the doormoved. In the dark without moon or stars a drawn blade gleamed,as if a chill light had been unsheathed. There was a blow, soft butheavy, and the door shuddered.‘Open, in the name of Mordor!’ said a voice thin and menacing.At a second blow the door yielded and fell back, with timbersburst and lock broken. The black figures passed swiftly in.At that moment, among the trees nearby, a horn rang out. It rentthe night like fire on a hill-top.awake! fear! fire! foes! awake!Fatty Bolger had not been idle. As soon as he saw the dark shapescreep from the garden, he knew that he must run for it, or perish.And run he did, out of the back door, through the garden, and overthe fields. When he reached the nearest house, more than a mileaway, he collapsed on the doorstep. ‘No, no, no!’ he was crying. ‘No,not me! I haven’t got it!’ It was some time before anyone could makeout what he was babbling about. At last they got the idea that enemiesA KN IFE IN TH E DAR K 177were in Buckland, some strange invasion from the Old Forest. Andthen they lost no more time.fear! fire! foes!The Brandybucks were blowing the Horn-call of Buckland, thathad not been sounded for a hundred years, not since the white wolvescame in the Fell Winter, when the Brandywine was frozen over.awake! awake!Far away answering horns were heard. The alarm was spreading.The black figures fled from the house. One of them let fall ahobbit-cloak on the step, as he ran. In the lane the noise of hoofsbroke out, and gathering to a gallop, went hammering away into thedarkness. All about Crickhollow there was the sound of horns blowing, and voices crying and feet running. But the Black Riders rodelike a gale to the North-gate. Let the little people blow! Sauron woulddeal with them later. Meanwhile they had another errand: they knewnow that the house was empty and the Ring had gone. They rodedown the guards at the gate and vanished from the Shire.In the early night Frodo woke from deep sleep, suddenly, as ifsome sound or presence had disturbed him. He saw that Strider wassitting alert in his chair: his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire,which had been tended and was burning brightly; but he made nosign or movement.Frodo soon went to sleep again; but his dreams were again troubledwith the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs. The wind seemed tobe curling round the house and shaking it; and far off he heard ahorn blowing wildly. He opened his eyes, and heard a cock crowinglustily in the inn-yard. Strider had drawn the curtains and pushedback the shutters with a clang. The first grey light of day was in theroom, and a cold air was coming through the open window.As soon as Strider had roused them all, he led the way to theirbedrooms. When they saw them they were glad that they had takenhis advice: the windows had been forced open and were swinging,and the curtains were flapping; the beds were tossed about, and thebolsters slashed and flung upon the floor; the brown mat was tornto pieces.Strider immediately went to fetch the landlord. Poor Mr.Butterbur looked sleepy and frightened. He had hardly closed hiseyes all night (so he said), but he had never heard a sound.178 T HE L ORD O F THE R INGS‘Never has such a thing happened in my time!’ he cried, raisinghis hands in horror. ‘Guests unable to sleep in their beds, and goodbolsters ruined and all! What are we coming to?’‘Dark times,’ said Strider. ‘But for the present you may be left inpeace, when you have got rid of us. We will leave at once. Nevermind about breakfast: a drink and a bite standing will have to do.We shall be packed in a few minutes.’Mr. Butterbur hurried off to see that their ponies were got ready,and to fetch them a ‘bite’. But very soon he came back in dismay.The ponies had vanished! The stable-doors had all been opened inthe night, and they were gone: not only Merry’s ponies, but everyother horse and beast in the place.Frodo was crushed by the news. How could they hope to reachRivendell on foot, pursued by mounted enemies? They might as wellset out for the Moon. Strider sat silent for a while, looking at thehobbits, as if he was weighing up their strength and courage.‘Ponies would not help us to escape horsemen,’ he said at last,thoughtfully, as if he guessed what Frodo had in mind. ‘We shouldnot go much slower on foot, not on the roads that I mean to take. Iwas going to walk in any case. It is the food and stores that troubleme. We cannot count on getting anything to eat between here andRivendell, except what we take with us; and we ought to take plentyto spare; for we may be delayed, or forced to go round-about, farout of the direct way. How much are you prepared to carry on yourbacks?’‘As much as we must,’ said Pippin with a sinking heart, but tryingto show that he was tougher than he looked (or felt).‘I can carry enough for two,’ said Sam defiantly.‘Can’t anything be done, Mr. Butterbur?’ asked Frodo. ‘Can’t weget a couple of ponies in the village, or even one just for the baggage?I don’t suppose we could hire them, but we might be able to buythem,’ he added, doubtfully, wondering if he could afford it.‘I doubt it,’ said the landlord unhappily. ‘The two or three ridingponies that there were in Bree were stabled in my yard, and they’regone. As for other animals, horses or ponies for draught or what not,there are very few of them in Bree, and they won’t be for sale. ButI’ll do what I can. I’ll rout out Bob and send him round as soon asmay be.’‘Yes,’ said Strider reluctantly, ‘you had better do that. I am afraidwe shall have to try to get one pony at least. But so ends all hope ofstarting early, and slipping away quietly! We might as well have blowna horn to announce our departure. That was part of their plan, nodoubt.’~
Hamlet`-1`-1`-1`-1`-1`ACT I
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO
BERNARDO
Who's there?
FRANCISCO
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
BERNARDO
Long live the king!
FRANCISCO
Bernardo?
BERNARDO
He.
FRANCISCO
You come most carefully upon your hour.
BERNARDO
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
FRANCISCO
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.
BERNARDO
Have you had quiet guard?
FRANCISCO
Not a mouse stirring.
BERNARDO
Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
FRANCISCO
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS

HORATIO
Friends to this ground.
MARCELLUS
And liegemen to the Dane.
FRANCISCO
Give you good night.
MARCELLUS
O, farewell, honest soldier:
Who hath relieved you?
FRANCISCO
Bernardo has my place.
Give you good night.
Exit

MARCELLUS
Holla! Bernardo!
BERNARDO
Say,
What, is Horatio there?
HORATIO
A piece of him.
BERNARDO
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
MARCELLUS
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
BERNARDO
I have seen nothing.
MARCELLUS
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
That if again this apparition come,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
HORATIO
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
BERNARDO
Sit down awhile;
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story
What we have two nights seen.
HORATIO
Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
BERNARDO
Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one,--
Enter Ghost

MARCELLUS
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
BERNARDO
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
MARCELLUS
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
BERNARDO
Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.
HORATIO
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
BERNARDO
It would be spoke to.
MARCELLUS
Question it, Horatio.
HORATIO
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
MARCELLUS
It is offended.
BERNARDO
See, it stalks away!
HORATIO
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
Exit Ghost

MARCELLUS
'Tis gone, and will not answer.
BERNARDO
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?
HORATIO
Before my God, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.
MARCELLUS
Is it not like the king?
HORATIO
As thou art to thyself:
Such was the very armour he had on
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
'Tis strange.
MARCELLUS
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
HORATIO
In what particular thought to work I know not;
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
MARCELLUS
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Why this same strict and most observant watch
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
And foreign mart for implements of war;
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Who is't that can inform me?
HORATIO
That can I;
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Against the which, a moiety competent
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
And carriage of the article design'd,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
As it doth well appear unto our state--
But to recover of us, by strong hand
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
The source of this our watch and the chief head
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
BERNARDO
I think it be no other but e'en so:
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
That was and is the question of these wars.
HORATIO
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
And prologue to the omen coming on,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
Re-enter Ghost

I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Speak to me:
If there be any good thing to be done,
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Speak to me:
Cock crows

If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
MARCELLUS
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
HORATIO
Do, if it will not stand.
BERNARDO
'Tis here!
HORATIO
'Tis here!
MARCELLUS
'Tis gone!
Exit Ghost

We do it wrong, being so majestical,
To offer it the show of violence;
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
BERNARDO
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
HORATIO
And then it started like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
To his confine: and of the truth herein
This present object made probation.
MARCELLUS
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
HORATIO
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
MARCELLUS
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
Exeunt

SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants
KING CLAUDIUS
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
Importing the surrender of those lands
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
The lists and full proportions, are all made
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
Giving to you no further personal power
To business with the king, more than the scope
Of these delated articles allow.
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND
In that and all things will we show our duty.
KING CLAUDIUS
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS

And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
The head is not more native to the heart,
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
LAERTES
My dread lord,
Your leave and favour to return to France;
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
To show my duty in your coronation,
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
KING CLAUDIUS
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
LORD POLONIUS
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
By laboursome petition, and at last
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
KING CLAUDIUS
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
HAMLET
[Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
KING CLAUDIUS
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
HAMLET
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Passing through nature to eternity.
HAMLET
Ay, madam, it is common.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
If it be,
Why seems it so particular with thee?
HAMLET
Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
For they are actions that a man might play:
But I have that within which passeth show;
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
KING CLAUDIUS
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
To give these mourning duties to your father:
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
In filial obligation for some term
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
In obstinate condolement is a course
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
An understanding simple and unschool'd:
For what we know must be and is as common
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
Why should we in our peevish opposition
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
To reason most absurd: whose common theme
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
As of a father: for let the world take note,
You are the most immediate to our throne;
And with no less nobility of love
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
It is most retrograde to our desire:
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
HAMLET
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
KING CLAUDIUS
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
Exeunt all but HAMLET

HAMLET
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
As if increase of appetite had grown
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
My father's brother, but no more like my father
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO

HORATIO
Hail to your lordship!
HAMLET
I am glad to see you well:
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
HORATIO
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
HAMLET
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
MARCELLUS
My good lord--
HAMLET
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
HORATIO
A truant disposition, good my lord.
HAMLET
I would not hear your enemy say so,
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
To make it truster of your own report
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
HORATIO
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
HAMLET
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
HORATIO
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
HAMLET
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
My father!--methinks I see my father.
HORATIO
Where, my lord?
HAMLET
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
HORATIO
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
HAMLET
He was a man, take him for all in all,
I shall not look upon his like again.
HORATIO
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
HAMLET
Saw? who?
HORATIO
My lord, the king your father.
HAMLET
The king my father!
HORATIO
Season your admiration for awhile
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
This marvel to you.
HAMLET
For God's love, let me hear.
HORATIO
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
Appears before them, and with solemn march
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
These hands are not more like.
HAMLET
But where was this?
MARCELLUS
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
HAMLET
Did you not speak to it?
HORATIO
My lord, I did;
But answer made it none: yet once methought
It lifted up its head and did address
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And vanish'd from our sight.
HAMLET
'Tis very strange.
HORATIO
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
And we did think it writ down in our duty
To let you know of it.
HAMLET
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Hold you the watch to-night?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
We do, my lord.
HAMLET
Arm'd, say you?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
Arm'd, my lord.
HAMLET
From top to toe?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
My lord, from head to foot.
HAMLET
Then saw you not his face?
HORATIO
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
HAMLET
What, look'd he frowningly?
HORATIO
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
HAMLET
Pale or red?
HORATIO
Nay, very pale.
HAMLET
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
HORATIO
Most constantly.
HAMLET
I would I had been there.
HORATIO
It would have much amazed you.
HAMLET
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
HORATIO
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
Longer, longer.
HORATIO
Not when I saw't.
HAMLET
His beard was grizzled--no?
HORATIO
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
A sable silver'd.
HAMLET
I will watch to-night;
Perchance 'twill walk again.
HORATIO
I warrant it will.
HAMLET
If it assume my noble father's person,
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
I'll visit you.
All
Our duty to your honour.
HAMLET
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
Exeunt all but HAMLET

My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit

SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.
Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA
LAERTES
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
But let me hear from you.
OPHELIA
Do you doubt that?
LAERTES
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
OPHELIA
No more but so?
LAERTES
Think it no more;
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
The inward service of the mind and soul
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
For he himself is subject to his birth:
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
The safety and health of this whole state;
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
As he in his particular act and place
May give his saying deed; which is no further
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
To his unmaster'd importunity.
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
OPHELIA
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
And recks not his own rede.
LAERTES
O, fear me not.
I stay too long: but here my father comes.
Enter POLONIUS

A double blessing is a double grace,
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
LORD POLONIUS
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
And these few precepts in thy memory
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
And they in France of the best rank and station
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all: to thine ownself be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
LAERTES
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
LAERTES
Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
What I have said to you.
OPHELIA
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
LAERTES
Farewell.
Exit

LORD POLONIUS
What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
OPHELIA
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
LORD POLONIUS
Marry, well bethought:
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
Given private time to you; and you yourself
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
You do not understand yourself so clearly
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
What is between you? give me up the truth.
OPHELIA
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
Of his affection to me.
LORD POLONIUS
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
OPHELIA
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
LORD POLONIUS
Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
OPHELIA
My lord, he hath importuned me with love
In honourable fashion.
LORD POLONIUS
Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
OPHELIA
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
LORD POLONIUS
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
You must not take for fire. From this time
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
Believe so much in him, that he is young
And with a larger tether may he walk
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
Not of that dye which their investments show,
But mere implorators of unholy suits,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
The better to beguile. This is for all:
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
Have you so slander any moment leisure,
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
OPHELIA
I shall obey, my lord.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. The platform.
Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS
HAMLET
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
HORATIO
It is a nipping and an eager air.
HAMLET
What hour now?
HORATIO
I think it lacks of twelve.
HAMLET
No, it is struck.
HORATIO
Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within

What does this mean, my lord?
HAMLET
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
The triumph of his pledge.
HORATIO
Is it a custom?
HAMLET
Ay, marry, is't:
But to my mind, though I am native here
And to the manner born, it is a custom
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
This heavy-headed revel east and west
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
So, oft it chances in particular men,
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
Since nature cannot choose his origin--
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
The form of plausive manners, that these men,
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
As infinite as man may undergo--
Shall in the general censure take corruption
From that particular fault: the dram of eale
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
To his own scandal.
HORATIO
Look, my lord, it comes!
Enter Ghost

HAMLET
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
Thou comest in such a questionable shape
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
So horridly to shake our disposition
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
Ghost beckons HAMLET

HORATIO
It beckons you to go away with it,
As if it some impartment did desire
To you alone.
MARCELLUS
Look, with what courteous action
It waves you to a more removed ground:
But do not go with it.
HORATIO
No, by no means.
HAMLET
It will not speak; then I will follow it.
HORATIO
Do not, my lord.
HAMLET
Why, what should be the fear?
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
Being a thing immortal as itself?
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
HORATIO
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
And there assume some other horrible form,
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
And draw you into madness? think of it:
The very place puts toys of desperation,
Without more motive, into every brain
That looks so many fathoms to the sea
And hears it roar beneath.
HAMLET
It waves me still.
Go on; I'll follow thee.
MARCELLUS
You shall not go, my lord.
HAMLET
Hold off your hands.
HORATIO
Be ruled; you shall not go.
HAMLET
My fate cries out,
And makes each petty artery in this body
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET

HORATIO
He waxes desperate with imagination.
MARCELLUS
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
HORATIO
Have after. To what issue will this come?
MARCELLUS
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
HORATIO
Heaven will direct it.
MARCELLUS
Nay, let's follow him.
Exeunt

SCENE V. Another part of the platform.
Enter GHOST and HAMLET
HAMLET
Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
Ghost
Mark me.
HAMLET
I will.
Ghost
My hour is almost come,
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
Must render up myself.
HAMLET
Alas, poor ghost!
Ghost
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
To what I shall unfold.
HAMLET
Speak; I am bound to hear.
Ghost
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
HAMLET
What?
Ghost
I am thy father's spirit,
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
Thy knotted and combined locks to part
And each particular hair to stand on end,
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
But this eternal blazon must not be
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
HAMLET
O God!
Ghost
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
HAMLET
Murder!
Ghost
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
HAMLET
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
May sweep to my revenge.
Ghost
I find thee apt;
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
Is by a forged process of my death
Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
The serpent that did sting thy father's life
Now wears his crown.
HAMLET
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
Ghost
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
From me, whose love was of that dignity
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
I made to her in marriage, and to decline
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
To those of mine!
But virtue, as it never will be moved,
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
And prey on garbage.
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
My custom always of the afternoon,
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
And in the porches of my ears did pour
The leperous distilment; whose effect
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
The natural gates and alleys of the body,
And with a sudden vigour doth posset
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
All my smooth body.
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
With all my imperfections on my head:
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
Exit

HAMLET
O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
Yea, from the table of my memory
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
That youth and observation copied there;
And thy commandment all alone shall live
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
O most pernicious woman!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
Writing

So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
I have sworn 't.
MARCELLUS HORATIO
[Within] My lord, my lord,--
MARCELLUS
[Within] Lord Hamlet,--
HORATIO
[Within] Heaven secure him!
HAMLET
So be it!
HORATIO
[Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
HAMLET
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS

MARCELLUS
How is't, my noble lord?
HORATIO
What news, my lord?
HAMLET
O, wonderful!
HORATIO
Good my lord, tell it.
HAMLET
No; you'll reveal it.
HORATIO
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
MARCELLUS
Nor I, my lord.
HAMLET
How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
But you'll be secret?
HORATIO MARCELLUS
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
HAMLET
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
But he's an arrant knave.
HORATIO
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
To tell us this.
HAMLET
Why, right; you are i' the right;
And so, without more circumstance at all,
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
You, as your business and desire shall point you;
For every man has business and desire,
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
Look you, I'll go pray.
HORATIO
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
HAMLET
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
Yes, 'faith heartily.
HORATIO
There's no offence, my lord.
HAMLET
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
For your desire to know what is between us,
O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
Give me one poor request.
HORATIO
What is't, my lord? we will.
HAMLET
Never make known what you have seen to-night.
HORATIO MARCELLUS
My lord, we will not.
HAMLET
Nay, but swear't.
HORATIO
In faith,
My lord, not I.
MARCELLUS
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
HAMLET
Upon my sword.
MARCELLUS
We have sworn, my lord, already.
HAMLET
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
Ghost
[Beneath] Swear.
HAMLET
Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
truepenny?
Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
Consent to swear.
HORATIO
Propose the oath, my lord.
HAMLET
Never to speak of this that you have seen,
Swear by my sword.
Ghost
[Beneath] Swear.
HAMLET
Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
Come hither, gentlemen,
And lay your hands again upon my sword:
Never to speak of this that you have heard,
Swear by my sword.
Ghost
[Beneath] Swear.
HAMLET
Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
HORATIO
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
HAMLET
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
To put an antic disposition on,
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
That you know aught of me: this not to do,
So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.
Ghost
[Beneath] Swear.
HAMLET
Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
They swear

So, gentlemen,
With all my love I do commend me to you:
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
May do, to express his love and friending to you,
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
That ever I was born to set it right!
Nay, come, let's go together.
Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. A room in POLONIUS' house.
Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO
LORD POLONIUS
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
REYNALDO
I will, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
Before you visit him, to make inquire
Of his behavior.
REYNALDO
My lord, I did intend it.
LORD POLONIUS
Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
What company, at what expense; and finding
By this encompassment and drift of question
That they do know my son, come you more nearer
Than your particular demands will touch it:
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
REYNALDO
Ay, very well, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
As are companions noted and most known
To youth and liberty.
REYNALDO
As gaming, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
Drabbing: you may go so far.
REYNALDO
My lord, that would dishonour him.
LORD POLONIUS
'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
You must not put another scandal on him,
That he is open to incontinency;
That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
That they may seem the taints of liberty,
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
Of general assault.
REYNALDO
But, my good lord,--
LORD POLONIUS
Wherefore should you do this?
REYNALDO
Ay, my lord,
I would know that.
LORD POLONIUS
Marry, sir, here's my drift;
And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
You laying these slight sullies on my son,
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
Your party in converse, him you would sound,
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
He closes with you in this consequence;
'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
According to the phrase or the addition
Of man and country.
REYNALDO
Very good, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
something: where did I leave?
REYNALDO
At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
and 'gentleman.'
LORD POLONIUS
At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
See you now;
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
With windlasses and with assays of bias,
By indirections find directions out:
So by my former lecture and advice,
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
REYNALDO
My lord, I have.
LORD POLONIUS
God be wi' you; fare you well.
REYNALDO
Good my lord!
LORD POLONIUS
Observe his inclination in yourself.
REYNALDO
I shall, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
And let him ply his music.
REYNALDO
Well, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
Farewell!
Exit REYNALDO

Enter OPHELIA

How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
OPHELIA
O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
LORD POLONIUS
With what, i' the name of God?
OPHELIA
My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
And with a look so piteous in purport
As if he had been loosed out of hell
To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
LORD POLONIUS
Mad for thy love?
OPHELIA
My lord, I do not know;
But truly, I do fear it.
LORD POLONIUS
What said he?
OPHELIA
He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
He falls to such perusal of my face
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
At last, a little shaking of mine arm
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
For out o' doors he went without their helps,
And, to the last, bended their light on me.
LORD POLONIUS
Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
This is the very ecstasy of love,
Whose violent property fordoes itself
And leads the will to desperate undertakings
As oft as any passion under heaven
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
What, have you given him any hard words of late?
OPHELIA
No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
I did repel his fetters and denied
His access to me.
LORD POLONIUS
That hath made him mad.
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
By heaven, it is as proper to our age
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
As it is common for the younger sort
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
This must be known; which, being kept close, might
move
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
Exeunt

SCENE II. A room in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants
KING CLAUDIUS
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
Moreover that we much did long to see you,
The need we have to use you did provoke
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
Resembles that it was. What it should be,
More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
So much from the understanding of himself,
I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
That, being of so young days brought up with him,
And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
Some little time: so by your companies
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
So much as from occasion you may glean,
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
And sure I am two men there are not living
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
To show us so much gentry and good will
As to expend your time with us awhile,
For the supply and profit of our hope,
Your visitation shall receive such thanks
As fits a king's remembrance.
ROSENCRANTZ
Both your majesties
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
Put your dread pleasures more into command
Than to entreaty.
GUILDENSTERN
But we both obey,
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
To lay our service freely at your feet,
To be commanded.
KING CLAUDIUS
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
And I beseech you instantly to visit
My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
GUILDENSTERN
Heavens make our presence and our practises
Pleasant and helpful to him!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Ay, amen!
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some Attendants

Enter POLONIUS

LORD POLONIUS
The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
Are joyfully return'd.
KING CLAUDIUS
Thou still hast been the father of good news.
LORD POLONIUS
Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
Both to my God and to my gracious king:
And I do think, or else this brain of mine
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
As it hath used to do, that I have found
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
KING CLAUDIUS
O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
LORD POLONIUS
Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
KING CLAUDIUS
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
Exit POLONIUS

He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
The head and source of all your son's distemper.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
I doubt it is no other but the main;
His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.
KING CLAUDIUS
Well, we shall sift him.
Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS

Welcome, my good friends!
Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
VOLTIMAND
Most fair return of greetings and desires.
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
But, better look'd into, he truly found
It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
That so his sickness, age and impotence
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
Makes vow before his uncle never more
To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
So levied as before, against the Polack:
With an entreaty, herein further shown,
Giving a paper

That it might please you to give quiet pass
Through your dominions for this enterprise,
On such regards of safety and allowance
As therein are set down.
KING CLAUDIUS
It likes us well;
And at our more consider'd time well read,
Answer, and think upon this business.
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
Most welcome home!
Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS

LORD POLONIUS
This business is well ended.
My liege, and madam, to expostulate
What majesty should be, what duty is,
Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
But let that go.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
More matter, with less art.
LORD POLONIUS
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
But farewell it, for I will use no art.
Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains
That we find out the cause of this effect,
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
For this effect defective comes by cause:
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.
I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
Reads

'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
beautified Ophelia,'--
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is
a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
Reads

'In her excellent white bosom, these, & c.'
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Came this from Hamlet to her?
LORD POLONIUS
Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
Reads

'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
Doubt that the sun doth move;
Doubt truth to be a liar;
But never doubt I love.
'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst
this machine is to him, HAMLET.'
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
And more above, hath his solicitings,
As they fell out by time, by means and place,
All given to mine ear.
KING CLAUDIUS
But how hath she
Received his love?
LORD POLONIUS
What do you think of me?
KING CLAUDIUS
As of a man faithful and honourable.
LORD POLONIUS
I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
Before my daughter told me--what might you,
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
What might you think? No, I went round to work,
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
That she should lock herself from his resort,
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
Into the madness wherein now he raves,
And all we mourn for.
KING CLAUDIUS
Do you think 'tis this?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
It may be, very likely.
LORD POLONIUS
Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
That I have positively said 'Tis so,'
When it proved otherwise?
KING CLAUDIUS
Not that I know.
LORD POLONIUS
[Pointing to his head and shoulder]
Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
If circumstances lead me, I will find
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
Within the centre.
KING CLAUDIUS
How may we try it further?
LORD POLONIUS
You know, sometimes he walks four hours together
Here in the lobby.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
So he does indeed.
LORD POLONIUS
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
Be you and I behind an arras then;
Mark the encounter: if he love her not
And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
Let me be no assistant for a state,
But keep a farm and carters.
KING CLAUDIUS
We will try it.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
LORD POLONIUS
Away, I do beseech you, both away:
I'll board him presently.
Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and Attendants

Enter HAMLET, reading

O, give me leave:
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
HAMLET
Well, God-a-mercy.
LORD POLONIUS
Do you know me, my lord?
HAMLET
Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.
LORD POLONIUS
Not I, my lord.
HAMLET
Then I would you were so honest a man.
LORD POLONIUS
Honest, my lord!
HAMLET
Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
one man picked out of ten thousand.
LORD POLONIUS
That's very true, my lord.
HAMLET
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?
LORD POLONIUS
I have, my lord.
HAMLET
Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
Friend, look to 't.
LORD POLONIUS
[Aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my
daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I
was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and
truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
What do you read, my lord?
HAMLET
Words, words, words.
LORD POLONIUS
What is the matter, my lord?
HAMLET
Between who?
LORD POLONIUS
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
HAMLET
Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab
you could go backward.
LORD POLONIUS
[Aside] Though this be madness, yet there is method
in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
HAMLET
Into my grave.
LORD POLONIUS
Indeed, that is out o' the air.
Aside

How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity
could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will
leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of
meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable
lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
HAMLET
You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will
more willingly part withal: except my life, except
my life, except my life.
LORD POLONIUS
Fare you well, my lord.
HAMLET
These tedious old fools!
Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

LORD POLONIUS
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
ROSENCRANTZ
[To POLONIUS] God save you, sir!
Exit POLONIUS

GUILDENSTERN
My honoured lord!
ROSENCRANTZ
My most dear lord!
HAMLET
My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
ROSENCRANTZ
As the indifferent children of the earth.
GUILDENSTERN
Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
HAMLET
Nor the soles of her shoe?
ROSENCRANTZ
Neither, my lord.
HAMLET
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of
her favours?
GUILDENSTERN
'Faith, her privates we.
HAMLET
In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she
is a strumpet. What's the news?
ROSENCRANTZ
None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
HAMLET
Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
Let me question more in particular: what have you,
my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
that she sends you to prison hither?
GUILDENSTERN
Prison, my lord!
HAMLET
Denmark's a prison.
ROSENCRANTZ
Then is the world one.
HAMLET
A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
ROSENCRANTZ
We think not so, my lord.
HAMLET
Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me
it is a prison.
ROSENCRANTZ
Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
narrow for your mind.
HAMLET
O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I
have bad dreams.
GUILDENSTERN
Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
HAMLET
A dream itself is but a shadow.
ROSENCRANTZ
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
HAMLET
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we
to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.
ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN
We'll wait upon you.
HAMLET
No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest
man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the
beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
ROSENCRANTZ
To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
HAMLET
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are
too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
GUILDENSTERN
What should we say, my lord?
HAMLET
Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
ROSENCRANTZ
To what end, my lord?
HAMLET
That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
love, and by what more dear a better proposer could
charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
whether you were sent for, or no?
ROSENCRANTZ
[Aside to GUILDENSTERN] What say you?
HAMLET
[Aside] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you
love me, hold not off.
GUILDENSTERN
My lord, we were sent for.
HAMLET
I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all
custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most
excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted
with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not
me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
you seem to say so.
ROSENCRANTZ
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
HAMLET
Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
ROSENCRANTZ
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
coming, to offer you service.
HAMLET
He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall
say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt
for't. What players are they?
ROSENCRANTZ
Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
tragedians of the city.
HAMLET
How chances it they travel? their residence, both
in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
ROSENCRANTZ
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
late innovation.
HAMLET
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
in the city? are they so followed?
ROSENCRANTZ
No, indeed, are they not.
HAMLET
How comes it? do they grow rusty?
ROSENCRANTZ
Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but
there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
that cry out on the top of question, and are most
tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the
fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they
call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.
HAMLET
What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
longer than they can sing? will they not say
afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
players--as it is most like, if their means are no
better--their writers do them wrong, to make them
exclaim against their own succession?
ROSENCRANTZ
'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and
the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid
for argument, unless the poet and the player went to
cuffs in the question.
HAMLET
Is't possible?
GUILDENSTERN
O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
HAMLET
Do the boys carry it away?
ROSENCRANTZ
Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
HAMLET
It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while
my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an
hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.
'Sblood, there is something in this more than
natural, if philosophy could find it out.
Flourish of trumpets within

GUILDENSTERN
There are the players.
HAMLET
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,
must show fairly outward, should more appear like
entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my
uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
GUILDENSTERN
In what, my dear lord?
HAMLET
I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.
Enter POLONIUS

LORD POLONIUS
Well be with you, gentlemen!
HAMLET
Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a
hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
out of his swaddling-clouts.
ROSENCRANTZ
Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
say an old man is twice a child.
HAMLET
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
'twas so indeed.
LORD POLONIUS
My lord, I have news to tell you.
HAMLET
My lord, I have news to tell you.
When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--
LORD POLONIUS
The actors are come hither, my lord.
HAMLET
Buz, buz!
LORD POLONIUS
Upon mine honour,--
HAMLET
Then came each actor on his ass,--
LORD POLONIUS
The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the
liberty, these are the only men.
HAMLET
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
LORD POLONIUS
What a treasure had he, my lord?
HAMLET
Why,
'One fair daughter and no more,
The which he loved passing well.'
LORD POLONIUS
[Aside] Still on my daughter.
HAMLET
Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
LORD POLONIUS
If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
that I love passing well.
HAMLET
Nay, that follows not.
LORD POLONIUS
What follows, then, my lord?
HAMLET
Why,
'As by lot, God wot,'
and then, you know,
'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--
the first row of the pious chanson will show you
more; for look, where my abridgement comes.
Enter four or five Players

You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad
to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is
nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like
apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the
ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en
to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
of your quality; come, a passionate speech.
First Player
What speech, my lord?
HAMLET
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas
caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well
digested in the scenes, set down with as much
modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
indict the author of affectation; but called it an
honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
at this line: let me see, let me see--
'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
That lend a tyrannous and damned light
To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
So, proceed you.
LORD POLONIUS
'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
good discretion.
First Player
'Anon he finds him
Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
Which was declining on the milky head
Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
And like a neutral to his will and matter,
Did nothing.
But, as we often see, against some storm,
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
The bold winds speechless and the orb below
As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
Now falls on Priam.
Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
In general synod 'take away her power;
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
As low as to the fiends!'
LORD POLONIUS
This is too long.
HAMLET
It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he
sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.
First Player
'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'
HAMLET
'The mobled queen?'
LORD POLONIUS
That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.
First Player
'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have
pronounced:
But if the gods themselves did see her then
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
The instant burst of clamour that she made,
Unless things mortal move them not at all,
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
And passion in the gods.'
LORD POLONIUS
Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has
tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.
HAMLET
'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
Good my lord, will you see the players well
bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for
they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
time: after your death you were better have a bad
epitaph than their ill report while you live.
LORD POLONIUS
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
HAMLET
God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man
after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?
Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less
they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
Take them in.
LORD POLONIUS
Come, sirs.
HAMLET
Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.
Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First

Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the
Murder of Gonzago?
First Player
Ay, my lord.
HAMLET
We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,
study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which
I would set down and insert in't, could you not?
First Player
Ay, my lord.
HAMLET
Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him
not.
Exit First Player

My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
welcome to Elsinore.
ROSENCRANTZ
Good my lord!
HAMLET
Ay, so, God be wi' ye;
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

Now I am alone.
O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Is it not monstrous that this player here,
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
Could force his soul so to his own conceit
That from her working all his visage wann'd,
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
For Hecuba!
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
That he should weep for her? What would he do,
Had he the motive and the cue for passion
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
Upon whose property and most dear life
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
Ha!
'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
To make oppression bitter, or ere this
I should have fatted all the region kites
With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
O, vengeance!
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
A scullion!
Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
That guilty creatures sitting at a play
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Been struck so to the soul that presently
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
Play something like the murder of my father
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
May be the devil: and the devil hath power
To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
As he is very potent with such spirits,
Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
More relative than this: the play 's the thing
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

ACT III
SCENE I. A room in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN
KING CLAUDIUS
And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
ROSENCRANTZ
He does confess he feels himself distracted;
But from what cause he will by no means speak.
GUILDENSTERN
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
When we would bring him on to some confession
Of his true state.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Did he receive you well?
ROSENCRANTZ
Most like a gentleman.
GUILDENSTERN
But with much forcing of his disposition.
ROSENCRANTZ
Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
Most free in his reply.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Did you assay him?
To any pastime?
ROSENCRANTZ
Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
To hear of it: they are about the court,
And, as I think, they have already order
This night to play before him.
LORD POLONIUS
'Tis most true:
And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
To hear and see the matter.
KING CLAUDIUS
With all my heart; and it doth much content me
To hear him so inclined.
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
And drive his purpose on to these delights.
ROSENCRANTZ
We shall, my lord.
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

KING CLAUDIUS
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
Affront Ophelia:
Her father and myself, lawful espials,
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
We may of their encounter frankly judge,
And gather by him, as he is behaved,
If 't be the affliction of his love or no
That thus he suffers for.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
I shall obey you.
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
That your good beauties be the happy cause
Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
To both your honours.
OPHELIA
Madam, I wish it may.
Exit QUEEN GERTRUDE

LORD POLONIUS
Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
We will bestow ourselves.
To OPHELIA

Read on this book;
That show of such an exercise may colour
Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--
'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage
And pious action we do sugar o'er
The devil himself.
KING CLAUDIUS
[Aside] O, 'tis too true!
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
Than is my deed to my most painted word:
O heavy burthen!
LORD POLONIUS
I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS

Enter HAMLET

HAMLET
To be, or not to be, that is the question,
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause: there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remember'd.
OPHELIA
Good my lord,
How does your honour for this many a day?
HAMLET
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
OPHELIA
My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
That I have longed long to re-deliver;
I pray you, now receive them.
HAMLET
No, not I;
I never gave you aught.
OPHELIA
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
Take these again; for to the noble mind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.
HAMLET
Ha, ha! are you honest?
OPHELIA
My lord?
HAMLET
Are you fair?
OPHELIA
What means your lordship?
HAMLET
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should
admit no discourse to your beauty.
OPHELIA
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
with honesty?
HAMLET
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
force of honesty can translate beauty into his
likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
time gives it proof. I did love you once.
OPHELIA
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
HAMLET
You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot
so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
it: I loved you not.
OPHELIA
I was the more deceived.
HAMLET
Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;
but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
were better my mother had not borne me: I am very
proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.
Where's your father?
OPHELIA
At home, my lord.
HAMLET
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the
fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.
OPHELIA
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
HAMLET
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for
thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a
nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs
marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,
and quickly too. Farewell.
OPHELIA
O heavenly powers, restore him!
HAMLET
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God
has given you one face, and you make yourselves
another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and
nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness
your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath
made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:
those that are married already, all but one, shall
live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a
nunnery, go.
Exit

OPHELIA
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS

KING CLAUDIUS
Love! his affections do not that way tend;
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
I have in quick determination
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
For the demand of our neglected tribute
Haply the seas and countries different
With variable objects shall expel
This something-settled matter in his heart,
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
LORD POLONIUS
It shall do well: but yet do I believe
The origin and commencement of his grief
Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
But, if you hold it fit, after the play
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
To show his grief: let her be round with him;
And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
Of all their conference. If she find him not,
To England send him, or confine him where
Your wisdom best shall think.
KING CLAUDIUS
It shall be so:
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
Exeunt

SCENE II. A hall in the castle.
Enter HAMLET and Players
HAMLET
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
as many of your players do, I had as lief the
town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
for the most part are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it
out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.
First Player
I warrant your honour.
HAMLET
Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
word to the action; with this special o'erstep not
the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
censure of the which one must in your allowance
o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
players that I have seen play, and heard others
praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
First Player
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
sir.
HAMLET
O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered:
that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.
Exeunt Players

Enter POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN

How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?
LORD POLONIUS
And the queen too, and that presently.
HAMLET
Bid the players make haste.
Exit POLONIUS

Will you two help to hasten them?
ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN
We will, my lord.
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

HAMLET
What ho! Horatio!
Enter HORATIO

HORATIO
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
HAMLET
Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
As e'er my conversation coped withal.
HORATIO
O, my dear lord,--
HAMLET
Nay, do not think I flatter;
For what advancement may I hope from thee
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
And could of men distinguish, her election
Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
There is a play to-night before the king;
One scene of it comes near the circumstance
Which I have told thee of my father's death:
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
Even with the very comment of thy soul
Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
And my imaginations are as foul
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
And after we will both our judgments join
In censure of his seeming.
HORATIO
Well, my lord:
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
HAMLET
They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
Get you a place.
Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others

KING CLAUDIUS
How fares our cousin Hamlet?
HAMLET
Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat
the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.
KING CLAUDIUS
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words
are not mine.
HAMLET
No, nor mine now.
To POLONIUS

My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?
LORD POLONIUS
That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.
HAMLET
What did you enact?
LORD POLONIUS
I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the
Capitol; Brutus killed me.
HAMLET
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be the players ready?
ROSENCRANTZ
Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
HAMLET
No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
LORD POLONIUS
[To KING CLAUDIUS] O, ho! do you mark that?
HAMLET
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
Lying down at OPHELIA's feet

OPHELIA
No, my lord.
HAMLET
I mean, my head upon your lap?
OPHELIA
Ay, my lord.
HAMLET
Do you think I meant country matters?
OPHELIA
I think nothing, my lord.
HAMLET
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
OPHELIA
What is, my lord?
HAMLET
Nothing.
OPHELIA
You are merry, my lord.
HAMLET
Who, I?
OPHELIA
Ay, my lord.
HAMLET
O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do
but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my
mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
OPHELIA
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
HAMLET
So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for
I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two
months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's
hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half
a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,
then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with
the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,
the hobby-horse is forgot.'
Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters

Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love

Exeunt

OPHELIA
What means this, my lord?
HAMLET
Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
OPHELIA
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
Enter Prologue

HAMLET
We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot
keep counsel; they'll tell all.
OPHELIA
Will he tell us what this show meant?
HAMLET
Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you
ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
OPHELIA
You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.
Prologue
For us, and for our tragedy,
Here stooping to your clemency,
We beg your hearing patiently.
Exit

HAMLET
Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
OPHELIA
'Tis brief, my lord.
HAMLET
As woman's love.
Enter two Players, King and Queen

Player King
Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
About the world have times twelve thirties been,
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
Player Queen
So many journeys may the sun and moon
Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
So far from cheer and from your former state,
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
For women's fear and love holds quantity;
In neither aught, or in extremity.
Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
Player King
'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
My operant powers their functions leave to do:
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind
For husband shalt thou--
Player Queen
O, confound the rest!
Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
In second husband let me be accurst!
None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
HAMLET
[Aside] Wormwood, wormwood.
Player Queen
The instances that second marriage move
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
A second time I kill my husband dead,
When second husband kisses me in bed.
Player King
I do believe you think what now you speak;
But what we do determine oft we break.
Purpose is but the slave to memory,
Of violent birth, but poor validity;
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
Most necessary 'tis that we forget
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
What to ourselves in passion we propose,
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The violence of either grief or joy
Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
Directly seasons him his enemy.
But, orderly to end where I begun,
Our wills and fates do so contrary run
That our devices still are overthrown;
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
Player Queen
Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
To desperation turn my trust and hope!
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
HAMLET
If she should break it now!
Player King
'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
The tedious day with sleep.
Sleeps

Player Queen
Sleep rock thy brain,
And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit

HAMLET
Madam, how like you this play?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
The lady protests too much, methinks.
HAMLET
O, but she'll keep her word.
KING CLAUDIUS
Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
HAMLET
No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence
i' the world.
KING CLAUDIUS
What do you call the play?
HAMLET
The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play
is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is
the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see
anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'
that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it
touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our
withers are unwrung.
Enter LUCIANUS

This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.
OPHELIA
You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
HAMLET
I could interpret between you and your love, if I
could see the puppets dallying.
OPHELIA
You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
HAMLET
It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
OPHELIA
Still better, and worse.
HAMLET
So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;
pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:
'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'
LUCIANUS
Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
Thy natural magic and dire property,
On wholesome life usurp immediately.
Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears

HAMLET
He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His
name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in
choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer
gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
OPHELIA
The king rises.
HAMLET
What, frighted with false fire!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
How fares my lord?
LORD POLONIUS
Give o'er the play.
KING CLAUDIUS
Give me some light: away!
All
Lights, lights, lights!
Exeunt all but HAMLET and HORATIO

HAMLET
Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
The hart ungalled play;
For some must watch, while some must sleep:
So runs the world away.
Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if
the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two
Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a
fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
HORATIO
Half a share.
HAMLET
A whole one, I.
For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
This realm dismantled was
Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
A very, very--pajock.
HORATIO
You might have rhymed.
HAMLET
O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a
thousand pound. Didst perceive?
HORATIO
Very well, my lord.
HAMLET
Upon the talk of the poisoning?
HORATIO
I did very well note him.
HAMLET
Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
For if the king like not the comedy,
Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
Come, some music!
Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

GUILDENSTERN
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
HAMLET
Sir, a whole history.
GUILDENSTERN
The king, sir,--
HAMLET
Ay, sir, what of him?
GUILDENSTERN
Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.
HAMLET
With drink, sir?
GUILDENSTERN
No, my lord, rather with choler.
HAMLET
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him
to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
more choler.
GUILDENSTERN
Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and
start not so wildly from my affair.
HAMLET
I am tame, sir: pronounce.
GUILDENSTERN
The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit, hath sent me to you.
HAMLET
You are welcome.
GUILDENSTERN
Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed. If it shall please you to make me a
wholesome answer, I will do your mother's
commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
shall be the end of my business.
HAMLET
Sir, I cannot.
GUILDENSTERN
What, my lord?
HAMLET
Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;
or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no
more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--
ROSENCRANTZ
Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her
into amazement and admiration.
HAMLET
O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's
admiration? Impart.
ROSENCRANTZ
She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you
go to bed.
HAMLET
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have
you any further trade with us?
ROSENCRANTZ
My lord, you once did love me.
HAMLET
So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
ROSENCRANTZ
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you
do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if
you deny your griefs to your friend.
HAMLET
Sir, I lack advancement.
ROSENCRANTZ
How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
himself for your succession in Denmark?
HAMLET
Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb
is something musty.
Re-enter Players with recorders

O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with
you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,
as if you would drive me into a toil?
GUILDENSTERN
O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
HAMLET
I do not well understand that. Will you play upon
this pipe?
GUILDENSTERN
My lord, I cannot.
HAMLET
I pray you.
GUILDENSTERN
Believe me, I cannot.
HAMLET
I do beseech you.
GUILDENSTERN
I know no touch of it, my lord.
HAMLET
'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with
your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your
mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.
Look you, these are the stops.
GUILDENSTERN
But these cannot I command to any utterance of
harmony; I have not the skill.
HAMLET
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of
me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know
my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my
mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to
the top of my compass: and there is much music,
excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot
you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am
easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you
cannot play upon me.
Enter POLONIUS

God bless you, sir!
LORD POLONIUS
My lord, the queen would speak with you, and
presently.
HAMLET
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
LORD POLONIUS
By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.
HAMLET
Methinks it is like a weasel.
LORD POLONIUS
It is backed like a weasel.
HAMLET
Or like a whale?
LORD POLONIUS
Very like a whale.
HAMLET
Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool
me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.
LORD POLONIUS
I will say so.
HAMLET
By and by is easily said.
Exit POLONIUS

Leave me, friends.
Exeunt all but HAMLET

Tis now the very witching time of night,
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
And do such bitter business as the day
Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.
O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
Let me be cruel, not unnatural:
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
How in my words soever she be shent,
To give them seals never, my soul, consent!
Exit

SCENE III. A room in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN
KING CLAUDIUS
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
And he to England shall along with you:
The terms of our estate may not endure
Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
Out of his lunacies.
GUILDENSTERN
We will ourselves provide:
Most holy and religious fear it is
To keep those many many bodies safe
That live and feed upon your majesty.
ROSENCRANTZ
The single and peculiar life is bound,
With all the strength and armour of the mind,
To keep itself from noyance; but much more
That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
The lives of many. The cease of majesty
Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw
What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
Each small annexment, petty consequence,
Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
KING CLAUDIUS
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
For we will fetters put upon this fear,
Which now goes too free-footed.
ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN
We will haste us.
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

Enter POLONIUS

LORD POLONIUS
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
Behind the arras I'll convey myself,
To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:
And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
And tell you what I know.
KING CLAUDIUS
Thanks, dear my lord.
Exit POLONIUS

O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
Though inclination be as sharp as will:
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
And, like a man to double business bound,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
But to confront the visage of offence?
And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
Of those effects for which I did the murder,
My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
In the corrupted currents of this world
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
There is no shuffling, there the action lies
In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
Try what repentance can: what can it not?
Yet what can it when one can not repent?
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!
All may be well.
Retires and kneels

Enter HAMLET

HAMLET
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;
And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:
A villain kills my father; and for that,
I, his sole son, do this same villain send
To heaven.
O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
He took my father grossly, full of bread;
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
But in our circumstance and course of thought,
'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,
To take him in the purging of his soul,
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
No!
Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:
When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
At gaming, swearing, or about some act
That has no relish of salvation in't;
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
Exit

KING CLAUDIUS
[Rising] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
Exit

SCENE IV. The Queen's closet.
Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE and POLONIUS
LORD POLONIUS
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.
Pray you, be round with him.
HAMLET
[Within] Mother, mother, mother!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
I'll warrant you,
Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.
POLONIUS hides behind the arras

Enter HAMLET

HAMLET
Now, mother, what's the matter?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
HAMLET
Mother, you have my father much offended.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
HAMLET
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Why, how now, Hamlet!
HAMLET
What's the matter now?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Have you forgot me?
HAMLET
No, by the rood, not so:
You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;
And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
HAMLET
Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
You go not till I set you up a glass
Where you may see the inmost part of you.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
Help, help, ho!
LORD POLONIUS
[Behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
HAMLET
[Drawing] How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!
Makes a pass through the arras

LORD POLONIUS
[Behind] O, I am slain!
Falls and dies

QUEEN GERTRUDE
O me, what hast thou done?
HAMLET
Nay, I know not:
Is it the king?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
HAMLET
A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
As kill a king!
HAMLET
Ay, lady, 'twas my word.
Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS

Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,
If it be made of penetrable stuff,
If damned custom have not brass'd it so
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue
In noise so rude against me?
HAMLET
Such an act
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
From the fair forehead of an innocent love
And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows
As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
As from the body of contraction plucks
The very soul, and sweet religion makes
A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:
Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
With tristful visage, as against the doom,
Is thought-sick at the act.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Ay me, what act,
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
HAMLET
Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
A station like the herald Mercury
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
A combination and a form indeed,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of a man:
This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
You cannot call it love; for at your age
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
But it reserved some quantity of choice,
To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Could not so mope.
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
Since frost itself as actively doth burn
And reason panders will.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
O Hamlet, speak no more:
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
And there I see such black and grained spots
As will not leave their tinct.
HAMLET
Nay, but to live
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
Over the nasty sty,--
QUEEN GERTRUDE
O, speak to me no more;
These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
No more, sweet Hamlet!
HAMLET
A murderer and a villain;
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
And put it in his pocket!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
No more!
HAMLET
A king of shreds and patches,--
Enter Ghost

Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,
You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Alas, he's mad!
HAMLET
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
The important acting of your dread command? O, say!
Ghost
Do not forget: this visitation
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
O, step between her and her fighting soul:
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
Speak to her, Hamlet.
HAMLET
How is it with you, lady?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Alas, how is't with you,
That you do bend your eye on vacancy
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
HAMLET
On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
Lest with this piteous action you convert
My stern effects: then what I have to do
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
To whom do you speak this?
HAMLET
Do you see nothing there?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
HAMLET
Nor did you nothing hear?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
No, nothing but ourselves.
HAMLET
Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
My father, in his habit as he lived!
Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!
Exit Ghost

QUEEN GERTRUDE
This the very coinage of your brain:
This bodiless creation ecstasy
Is very cunning in.
HAMLET
Ecstasy!
My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
And I the matter will re-word; which madness
Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
For in the fatness of these pursy times
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
HAMLET
O, throw away the worser part of it,
And live the purer with the other half.
Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
That to the use of actions fair and good
He likewise gives a frock or livery,
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
And either [ ] the devil, or throw him out
With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
Pointing to POLONIUS

I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
To punish me with this and this with me,
That I must be their scourge and minister.
I will bestow him, and will answer well
The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
I must be cruel, only to be kind:
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
One word more, good lady.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
What shall I do?
HAMLET
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
Make you to ravel all this matter out,
That I essentially am not in madness,
But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
Unpeg the basket on the house's top.
Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
And break your own neck down.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
What thou hast said to me.
HAMLET
I must to England; you know that?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Alack,
I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
HAMLET
There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
For 'tis the sport to have the engineer
Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
But I will delve one yard below their mines,
And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
When in one line two crafts directly meet.
This man shall set me packing:
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor
Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
Good night, mother.
Exeunt severally; HAMLET dragging in POLONIUS

ACT IV
SCENE I. A room in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN
KING CLAUDIUS
There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
Where is your son?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Bestow this place on us a little while.
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
KING CLAUDIUS
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
Behind the arras hearing something stir,
Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'
And, in this brainish apprehension, kills
The unseen good old man.
KING CLAUDIUS
O heavy deed!
It had been so with us, had we been there:
His liberty is full of threats to all;
To you yourself, to us, to every one.
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
It will be laid to us, whose providence
Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,
This mad young man: but so much was our love,
We would not understand what was most fit;
But, like the owner of a foul disease,
To keep it from divulging, let it feed
Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
Among a mineral of metals base,
Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.
KING CLAUDIUS
O Gertrude, come away!
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed
We must, with all our majesty and skill,
Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
And let them know, both what we mean to do,
And what's untimely done. O, come away!
My soul is full of discord and dismay.
Exeunt

SCENE II. Another room in the castle.
Enter HAMLET
HAMLET
Safely stowed.
ROSENCRANTZ: GUILDENSTERN:
[Within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
HAMLET
What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
O, here they come.
Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

ROSENCRANTZ
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
HAMLET
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
ROSENCRANTZ
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
And bear it to the chapel.
HAMLET
Do not believe it.
ROSENCRANTZ
Believe what?
HAMLET
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what
replication should be made by the son of a king?
ROSENCRANTZ
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
HAMLET
Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his
rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the
king best service in the end: he keeps them, like
an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to
be last swallowed: when he needs what you have
gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you
shall be dry again.
ROSENCRANTZ
I understand you not, my lord.
HAMLET
I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
foolish ear.
ROSENCRANTZ
My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go
with us to the king.
HAMLET
The body is with the king, but the king is not with
the body. The king is a thing--
GUILDENSTERN
A thing, my lord!
HAMLET
Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
Exeunt

SCENE III. Another room in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, attended
KING CLAUDIUS
I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
He's loved of the distracted multitude,
Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
This sudden sending him away must seem
Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
By desperate appliance are relieved,
Or not at all.
Enter ROSENCRANTZ

How now! what hath befall'n?
ROSENCRANTZ
Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
We cannot get from him.
KING CLAUDIUS
But where is he?
ROSENCRANTZ
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
KING CLAUDIUS
Bring him before us.
ROSENCRANTZ
Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
Enter HAMLET and GUILDENSTERN

KING CLAUDIUS
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
HAMLET
At supper.
KING CLAUDIUS
At supper! where?
HAMLET
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your
worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all
creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for
maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but
variable service, two dishes, but to one table:
that's the end.
KING CLAUDIUS
Alas, alas!
HAMLET
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
KING CLAUDIUS
What dost you mean by this?
HAMLET
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
progress through the guts of a beggar.
KING CLAUDIUS
Where is Polonius?
HAMLET
In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger
find him not there, seek him i' the other place
yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within
this month, you shall nose him as you go up the
stairs into the lobby.
KING CLAUDIUS
Go seek him there.
To some Attendants

HAMLET
He will stay till ye come.
Exeunt Attendants

KING CLAUDIUS
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence
With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
The associates tend, and every thing is bent
For England.
HAMLET
For England!
KING CLAUDIUS
Ay, Hamlet.
HAMLET
Good.
KING CLAUDIUS
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
HAMLET
I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for
England! Farewell, dear mother.
KING CLAUDIUS
Thy loving father, Hamlet.
HAMLET
My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man
and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit

KING CLAUDIUS
Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
Away! for every thing is seal'd and done
That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set
Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
By letters congruing to that effect,
The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.
Exit

SCENE IV. A plain in Denmark.
Enter FORTINBRAS, a Captain, and Soldiers, marching
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;
Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras
Craves the conveyance of a promised march
Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
If that his majesty would aught with us,
We shall express our duty in his eye;
And let him know so.
Captain
I will do't, my lord.
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
Go softly on.
Exeunt FORTINBRAS and Soldiers

Enter HAMLET, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others

HAMLET
Good sir, whose powers are these?
Captain
They are of Norway, sir.
HAMLET
How purposed, sir, I pray you?
Captain
Against some part of Poland.
HAMLET
Who commands them, sir?
Captain
The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.
HAMLET
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
Or for some frontier?
Captain
Truly to speak, and with no addition,
We go to gain a little patch of ground
That hath in it no profit but the name.
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
HAMLET
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
Captain
Yes, it is already garrison'd.
HAMLET
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
Will not debate the question of this straw:
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.
Captain
God be wi' you, sir.
Exit

ROSENCRANTZ
Wilt please you go, my lord?
HAMLET
I'll be with you straight go a little before.
Exeunt all except HAMLET

How all occasions do inform against me,
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
If his chief good and market of his time
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
Looking before and after, gave us not
That capability and god-like reason
To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be
Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
Of thinking too precisely on the event,
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
And ever three parts coward, I do not know
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
Witness this army of such mass and charge
Led by a delicate and tender prince,
Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
Makes mouths at the invisible event,
Exposing what is mortal and unsure
To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
Is not to stir without great argument,
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
Excitements of my reason and my blood,
And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
Which is not tomb enough and continent
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
Exit

SCENE V. Elsinore. A room in the castle.
Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE, HORATIO, and a Gentleman
QUEEN GERTRUDE
I will not speak with her.
Gentleman
She is importunate, indeed distract:
Her mood will needs be pitied.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
What would she have?
Gentleman
She speaks much of her father; says she hears
There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures
yield them,
Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
HORATIO
'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Let her come in.
Exit HORATIO

To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:
So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
Re-enter HORATIO, with OPHELIA

OPHELIA
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
How now, Ophelia!
OPHELIA
[Sings]
How should I your true love know
From another one?
By his cockle hat and staff,
And his sandal shoon.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
OPHELIA
Say you? nay, pray you, mark.
Sings

He is dead and gone, lady,
He is dead and gone;
At his head a grass-green turf,
At his heels a stone.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Nay, but, Ophelia,--
OPHELIA
Pray you, mark.
Sings

White his shroud as the mountain snow,--
Enter KING CLAUDIUS

QUEEN GERTRUDE
Alas, look here, my lord.
OPHELIA
[Sings]
Larded with sweet flowers
Which bewept to the grave did go
With true-love showers.
KING CLAUDIUS
How do you, pretty lady?
OPHELIA
Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not
what we may be. God be at your table!
KING CLAUDIUS
Conceit upon her father.
OPHELIA
Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they
ask you what it means, say you this:
Sings

To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
All in the morning betime,
And I a maid at your window,
To be your Valentine.
Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,
And dupp'd the chamber-door;
Let in the maid, that out a maid
Never departed more.
KING CLAUDIUS
Pretty Ophelia!
OPHELIA
Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
Sings

By Gis and by Saint Charity,
Alack, and fie for shame!
Young men will do't, if they come to't;
By cock, they are to blame.
Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
You promised me to wed.
So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
An thou hadst not come to my bed.
KING CLAUDIUS
How long hath she been thus?
OPHELIA
I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I
cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him
i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:
and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my
coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;
good night, good night.
Exit

KING CLAUDIUS
Follow her close; give her good watch,
I pray you.
Exit HORATIO

O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
When sorrows come, they come not single spies
But in battalions. First, her father slain:
Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,
In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
Last, and as much containing as all these,
Her brother is in secret come from France;
Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
Will nothing stick our person to arraign
In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
Like to a murdering-piece, in many places
Gives me superfluous death.
A noise within

QUEEN GERTRUDE
Alack, what noise is this?
KING CLAUDIUS
Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
Enter another Gentleman

What is the matter?
Gentleman
Save yourself, my lord:
The ocean, overpeering of his list,
Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;
And, as the world were now but to begin,
Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
The ratifiers and props of every word,
They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'
Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:
'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'
QUEEN GERTRUDE
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
KING CLAUDIUS
The doors are broke.
Noise within

Enter LAERTES, armed; Danes following

LAERTES
Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.
Danes
No, let's come in.
LAERTES
I pray you, give me leave.
Danes
We will, we will.
They retire without the door

LAERTES
I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,
Give me my father!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Calmly, good Laertes.
LAERTES
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot
Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
Of my true mother.
KING CLAUDIUS
What is the cause, Laertes,
That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
That treason can but peep to what it would,
Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.
Speak, man.
LAERTES
Where is my father?
KING CLAUDIUS
Dead.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
But not by him.
KING CLAUDIUS
Let him demand his fill.
LAERTES
How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
That both the worlds I give to negligence,
Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged
Most thoroughly for my father.
KING CLAUDIUS
Who shall stay you?
LAERTES
My will, not all the world:
And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
They shall go far with little.
KING CLAUDIUS
Good Laertes,
If you desire to know the certainty
Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
Winner and loser?
LAERTES
None but his enemies.
KING CLAUDIUS
Will you know them then?
LAERTES
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
Repast them with my blood.
KING CLAUDIUS
Why, now you speak
Like a good child and a true gentleman.
That I am guiltless of your father's death,
And am most sensible in grief for it,
It shall as level to your judgment pierce
As day does to your eye.
Danes
[Within] Let her come in.
LAERTES
How now! what noise is that?
Re-enter OPHELIA

O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits
Should be as moral as an old man's life?
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
It sends some precious instance of itself
After the thing it loves.
OPHELIA
[Sings]
They bore him barefaced on the bier;
Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;
And in his grave rain'd many a tear:--
Fare you well, my dove!
LAERTES
Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
It could not move thus.
OPHELIA
[Sings]
You must sing a-down a-down,
An you call him a-down-a.
O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false
steward, that stole his master's daughter.
LAERTES
This nothing's more than matter.
OPHELIA
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,
love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.
LAERTES
A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.
OPHELIA
There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue
for you; and here's some for me: we may call it
herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with
a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you
some violets, but they withered all when my father
died: they say he made a good end,--
Sings

For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
LAERTES
Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
She turns to favour and to prettiness.
OPHELIA
[Sings]
And will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
No, no, he is dead:
Go to thy death-bed:
He never will come again.
His beard was as white as snow,
All flaxen was his poll:
He is gone, he is gone,
And we cast away moan:
God ha' mercy on his soul!
And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.
Exit

LAERTES
Do you see this, O God?
KING CLAUDIUS
Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:
If by direct or by collateral hand
They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,
To you in satisfaction; but if not,
Be you content to lend your patience to us,
And we shall jointly labour with your soul
To give it due content.
LAERTES
Let this be so;
His means of death, his obscure funeral--
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
No noble rite nor formal ostentation--
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
That I must call't in question.
KING CLAUDIUS
So you shall;
And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
I pray you, go with me.
Exeunt

SCENE VI. Another room in the castle.
Enter HORATIO and a Servant
HORATIO
What are they that would speak with me?
Servant
Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.
HORATIO
Let them come in.
Exit Servant

I do not know from what part of the world
I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
Enter Sailors

First Sailor
God bless you, sir.
HORATIO
Let him bless thee too.
First Sailor
He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was
bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am
let to know it is.
HORATIO
[Reads] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked
this, give these fellows some means to the king:
they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old
at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us
chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on
a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded
them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so
I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with
me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they
did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king
have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me
with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I
have words to speak in thine ear will make thee
dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of
the matter. These good fellows will bring thee
where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
course for England: of them I have much to tell
thee. Farewell.
'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'
Come, I will make you way for these your letters;
And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
To him from whom you brought them.
Exeunt

SCENE VII. Another room in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES
KING CLAUDIUS
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
And you must put me in your heart for friend,
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
That he which hath your noble father slain
Pursued my life.
LAERTES
It well appears: but tell me
Why you proceeded not against these feats,
So crimeful and so capital in nature,
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
You mainly were stirr'd up.
KING CLAUDIUS
O, for two special reasons;
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--
My virtue or my plague, be it either which--
She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
I could not but by her. The other motive,
Why to a public count I might not go,
Is the great love the general gender bear him;
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
Would have reverted to my bow again,
And not where I had aim'd them.
LAERTES
And so have I a noble father lost;
A sister driven into desperate terms,
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
Stood challenger on mount of all the age
For her perfections: but my revenge will come.
KING CLAUDIUS
Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
That we can let our beard be shook with danger
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
I loved your father, and we love ourself;
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--
Enter a Messenger

How now! what news?
Messenger
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
This to your majesty; this to the queen.
KING CLAUDIUS
From Hamlet! who brought them?
Messenger
Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:
They were given me by Claudio; he received them
Of him that brought them.
KING CLAUDIUS
Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.
Exit Messenger

Reads

'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on
your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see
your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your
pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden
and more strange return. 'HAMLET.'
What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
LAERTES
Know you the hand?
KING CLAUDIUS
'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!
And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
Can you advise me?
LAERTES
I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
It warms the very sickness in my heart,
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
'Thus didest thou.'
KING CLAUDIUS
If it be so, Laertes--
As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
Will you be ruled by me?
LAERTES
Ay, my lord;
So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
KING CLAUDIUS
To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
As checking at his voyage, and that he means
No more to undertake it, I will work him
To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
And call it accident.
LAERTES
My lord, I will be ruled;
The rather, if you could devise it so
That I might be the organ.
KING CLAUDIUS
It falls right.
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts
Did not together pluck such envy from him
As did that one, and that, in my regard,
Of the unworthiest siege.
LAERTES
What part is that, my lord?
KING CLAUDIUS
A very riband in the cap of youth,
Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
The light and careless livery that it wears
Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured
With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
Come short of what he did.
LAERTES
A Norman was't?
KING CLAUDIUS
A Norman.
LAERTES
Upon my life, Lamond.
KING CLAUDIUS
The very same.
LAERTES
I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
And gem of all the nation.
KING CLAUDIUS
He made confession of you,
And gave you such a masterly report
For art and exercise in your defence
And for your rapier most especially,
That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
That he could nothing do but wish and beg
Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
Now, out of this,--
LAERTES
What out of this, my lord?
KING CLAUDIUS
Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
A face without a heart?
LAERTES
Why ask you this?
KING CLAUDIUS
Not that I think you did not love your father;
But that I know love is begun by time;
And that I see, in passages of proof,
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
There lives within the very flame of love
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
And nothing is at a like goodness still;
For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
Dies in his own too much: that we would do
We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
And hath abatements and delays as many
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
To show yourself your father's son in deed
More than in words?
LAERTES
To cut his throat i' the church.
KING CLAUDIUS
No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
And set a double varnish on the fame
The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
Most generous and free from all contriving,
Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise
Requite him for your father.
LAERTES
I will do't:
And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
I bought an unction of a mountebank,
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
Collected from all simples that have virtue
Under the moon, can save the thing from death
That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
It may be death.
KING CLAUDIUS
Let's further think of this;
Weigh what convenience both of time and means
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
And that our drift look through our bad performance,
'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
Should have a back or second, that might hold,
If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.
When in your motion you are hot and dry--
As make your bouts more violent to that end--
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him
A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
Our purpose may hold there.
Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE

How now, sweet queen!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
LAERTES
Drown'd! O, where?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
There with fantastic garlands did she come
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
When down her weedy trophies and herself
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
As one incapable of her own distress,
Or like a creature native and indued
Unto that element: but long it could not be
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
To muddy death.
LAERTES
Alas, then, she is drown'd?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Drown'd, drown'd.
LAERTES
Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
But that this folly douts it.
Exit

KING CLAUDIUS
Let's follow, Gertrude:
How much I had to do to calm his rage!
Now fear I this will give it start again;
Therefore let's follow.
Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. A churchyard.
Enter two Clowns, with spades, & c
First Clown
Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
wilfully seeks her own salvation?
Second Clown
I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave
straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it
Christian burial.
First Clown
How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her
own defence?
Second Clown
Why, 'tis found so.
First Clown
It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For
here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly,
it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it
is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned
herself wittingly.
Second Clown
Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--
First Clown
Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here
stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,
and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he
goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him
and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he
that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
Second Clown
But is this law?
First Clown
Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.
Second Clown
Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been
a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'
Christian burial.
First Clown
Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that
great folk should have countenance in this world to
drown or hang themselves, more than their even
Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient
gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:
they hold up Adam's profession.
Second Clown
Was he a gentleman?
First Clown
He was the first that ever bore arms.
Second Clown
Why, he had none.
First Clown
What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'
could he dig without arms? I'll put another
question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
purpose, confess thyself--
Second Clown
Go to.
First Clown
What is he that builds stronger than either the
mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
Second Clown
The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a
thousand tenants.
First Clown
I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows
does well; but how does it well? it does well to
those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the
gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,
the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.
Second Clown
'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or
a carpenter?'
First Clown
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
Second Clown
Marry, now I can tell.
First Clown
To't.
Second Clown
Mass, I cannot tell.
Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distance

First Clown
Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull
ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when
you are asked this question next, say 'a
grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till
doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a
stoup of liquor.
Exit Second Clown

He digs and sings

In youth, when I did love, did love,
Methought it was very sweet,
To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,
O, methought, there was nothing meet.
HAMLET
Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he
sings at grave-making?
HORATIO
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
HAMLET
'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath
the daintier sense.
First Clown
[Sings]
But age, with his stealing steps,
Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
And hath shipped me intil the land,
As if I had never been such.
Throws up a skull

HAMLET
That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:
how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were
Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It
might be the pate of a politician, which this ass
now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,
might it not?
HORATIO
It might, my lord.
HAMLET
Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,
sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might
be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord
such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?
HORATIO
Ay, my lord.
HAMLET
Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and
knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:
here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to
see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,
but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.
First Clown
[Sings]
A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,
For and a shrouding sheet:
O, a pit of clay for to be made
For such a guest is meet.
Throws up another skull

HAMLET
There's another: why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,
his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he
suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of
his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be
in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,
his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and
the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him
no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than
the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The
very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?
HORATIO
Not a jot more, my lord.
HAMLET
Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
HORATIO
Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.
HAMLET
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose
grave's this, sirrah?
First Clown
Mine, sir.
Sings

O, a pit of clay for to be made
For such a guest is meet.
HAMLET
I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.
First Clown
You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not
yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.
HAMLET
'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
First Clown
'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to
you.
HAMLET
What man dost thou dig it for?
First Clown
For no man, sir.
HAMLET
What woman, then?
First Clown
For none, neither.
HAMLET
Who is to be buried in't?
First Clown
One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
HAMLET
How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the
card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,
Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of
it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he
gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a
grave-maker?
First Clown
Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day
that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
HAMLET
How long is that since?
First Clown
Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it
was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that
is mad, and sent into England.
HAMLET
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
First Clown
Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits
there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
HAMLET
Why?
First Clown
'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men
are as mad as he.
HAMLET
How came he mad?
First Clown
Very strangely, they say.
HAMLET
How strangely?
First Clown
Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
HAMLET
Upon what ground?
First Clown
Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man
and boy, thirty years.
HAMLET
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
First Clown
I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we
have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce
hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year
or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.
HAMLET
Why he more than another?
First Clown
Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
he will keep out water a great while; and your water
is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth
three and twenty years.
HAMLET
Whose was it?
First Clown
A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
HAMLET
Nay, I know not.
First Clown
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a
flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,
sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.
HAMLET
This?
First Clown
E'en that.
HAMLET
Let me see.
Takes the skull

Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow
of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath
borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how
abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at
it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your
gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one
now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?
Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let
her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must
come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell
me one thing.
HORATIO
What's that, my lord?
HAMLET
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'
the earth?
HORATIO
E'en so.
HAMLET
And smelt so? pah!
Puts down the skull

HORATIO
E'en so, my lord.
HAMLET
To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may
not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,
till he find it stopping a bung-hole?
HORATIO
'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
HAMLET
No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as
thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,
Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of
earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he
was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?
Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!
But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.
Enter Priest, & c. in procession; the Corpse of OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, their trains, & c

The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
The corse they follow did with desperate hand
Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.
Couch we awhile, and mark.
Retiring with HORATIO

LAERTES
What ceremony else?
HAMLET
That is Laertes,
A very noble youth: mark.
LAERTES
What ceremony else?
First Priest
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;
And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,
Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;
Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
Of bell and burial.
LAERTES
Must there no more be done?
First Priest
No more be done:
We should profane the service of the dead
To sing a requiem and such rest to her
As to peace-parted souls.
LAERTES
Lay her i' the earth:
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
A ministering angel shall my sister be,
When thou liest howling.
HAMLET
What, the fair Ophelia!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
Scattering flowers

I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
And not have strew'd thy grave.
LAERTES
O, treble woe
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
Leaps into the grave

Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head
Of blue Olympus.
HAMLET
[Advancing] What is he whose grief
Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
Hamlet the Dane.
Leaps into the grave

LAERTES
The devil take thy soul!
Grappling with him

HAMLET
Thou pray'st not well.
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
Yet have I something in me dangerous,
Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.
KING CLAUDIUS
Pluck them asunder.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Hamlet, Hamlet!
All
Gentlemen,--
HORATIO
Good my lord, be quiet.
The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave

HAMLET
Why I will fight with him upon this theme
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
O my son, what theme?
HAMLET
I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
Could not, with all their quantity of love,
Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
KING CLAUDIUS
O, he is mad, Laertes.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
For love of God, forbear him.
HAMLET
'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
I'll rant as well as thou.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
This is mere madness:
And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
Anon, as patient as the female dove,
When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
His silence will sit drooping.
HAMLET
Hear you, sir;
What is the reason that you use me thus?
I loved you ever: but it is no matter;
Let Hercules himself do what he may,
The cat will mew and dog will have his day.
Exit

KING CLAUDIUS
I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.
Exit HORATIO

To LAERTES

Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
We'll put the matter to the present push.
Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
This grave shall have a living monument:
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
Exeunt

SCENE II. A hall in the castle.
Enter HAMLET and HORATIO
HAMLET
So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
You do remember all the circumstance?
HORATIO
Remember it, my lord?
HAMLET
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
Rough-hew them how we will,--
HORATIO
That is most certain.
HAMLET
Up from my cabin,
My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
To mine own room again; making so bold,
My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
O royal knavery!--an exact command,
Larded with many several sorts of reasons
Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
My head should be struck off.
HORATIO
Is't possible?
HAMLET
Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
HORATIO
I beseech you.
HAMLET
Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
They had begun the play--I sat me down,
Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
The effect of what I wrote?
HORATIO
Ay, good my lord.
HAMLET
An earnest conjuration from the king,
As England was his faithful tributary,
As love between them like the palm might flourish,
As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
Without debatement further, more or less,
He should the bearers put to sudden death,
Not shriving-time allow'd.
HORATIO
How was this seal'd?
HAMLET
Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
I had my father's signet in my purse,
Which was the model of that Danish seal;
Folded the writ up in form of the other,
Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
The changeling never known. Now, the next day
Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
Thou know'st already.
HORATIO
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
HAMLET
Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
They are not near my conscience; their defeat
Does by their own insinuation grow:
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
Between the pass and fell incensed points
Of mighty opposites.
HORATIO
Why, what a king is this!
HAMLET
Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
To let this canker of our nature come
In further evil?
HORATIO
It must be shortly known to him from England
What is the issue of the business there.
HAMLET
It will be short: the interim is mine;
And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
That to Laertes I forgot myself;
For, by the image of my cause, I see
The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.
But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
Into a towering passion.
HORATIO
Peace! who comes here?
Enter OSRIC

OSRIC
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
HAMLET
I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
HORATIO
No, my good lord.
HAMLET
Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a
beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at
the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,
spacious in the possession of dirt.
OSRIC
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I
should impart a thing to you from his majesty.
HAMLET
I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.
OSRIC
I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
HAMLET
No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
northerly.
OSRIC
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
HAMLET
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
OSRIC
Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as
'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his
majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--
HAMLET
I beseech you, remember--
HAMLET moves him to put on his hat

OSRIC
Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.
Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe
me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent
differences, of very soft society and great showing:
indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
continent of what part a gentleman would see.
HAMLET
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
though, I know, to divide him inventorially would
dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great article; and his infusion of such dearth and
rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace
him, his umbrage, nothing more.
OSRIC
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
HAMLET
The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
in our more rawer breath?
OSRIC
Sir?
HORATIO
Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
You will do't, sir, really.
HAMLET
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
OSRIC
Of Laertes?
HORATIO
His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
HAMLET
Of him, sir.
OSRIC
I know you are not ignorant--
HAMLET
I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
it would not much approve me. Well, sir?
OSRIC
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--
HAMLET
I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with
him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to
know himself.
OSRIC
I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
HAMLET
What's his weapon?
OSRIC
Rapier and dagger.
HAMLET
That's two of his weapons: but, well.
OSRIC
The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take
it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the
carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
and of very liberal conceit.
HAMLET
What call you the carriages?
HORATIO
I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
OSRIC
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
HAMLET
The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might
be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses
against six French swords, their assigns, and three
liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet
against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?
OSRIC
The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it
would come to immediate trial, if your lordship
would vouchsafe the answer.
HAMLET
How if I answer 'no'?
OSRIC
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
HAMLET
Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;
if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
OSRIC
Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
HAMLET
To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
OSRIC
I commend my duty to your lordship.
HAMLET
Yours, yours.
Exit OSRIC

He does well to commend it himself; there are no
tongues else for's turn.
HORATIO
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
HAMLET
He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I
know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of
the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of
yesty collection, which carries them through and
through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do
but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.
Enter a Lord

Lord
My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
HAMLET
I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's
pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now
or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
Lord
The king and queen and all are coming down.
HAMLET
In happy time.
Lord
The queen desires you to use some gentle
entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
HAMLET
She well instructs me.
Exit Lord

HORATIO
You will lose this wager, my lord.
HAMLET
I do not think so: since he went into France, I
have been in continual practise: I shall win at the
odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
about my heart: but it is no matter.
HORATIO
Nay, good my lord,--
HAMLET
It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.
HORATIO
If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will
forestall their repair hither, and say you are not
fit.
HAMLET
Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the
readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he
leaves, what is't to leave betimes?
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES, Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, & c

KING CLAUDIUS
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's

HAMLET
Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
This presence knows,
And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
With sore distraction. What I have done,
That might your nature, honour and exception
Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
Sir, in this audience,
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
And hurt my brother.
LAERTES
I am satisfied in nature,
Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
I have a voice and precedent of peace,
To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
I do receive your offer'd love like love,
And will not wrong it.
HAMLET
I embrace it freely;
And will this brother's wager frankly play.
Give us the foils. Come on.
LAERTES
Come, one for me.
HAMLET
I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
Stick fiery off indeed.
LAERTES
You mock me, sir.
HAMLET
No, by this hand.
KING CLAUDIUS
Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
You know the wager?
HAMLET
Very well, my lord
Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.
KING CLAUDIUS
I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
LAERTES
This is too heavy, let me see another.
HAMLET
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
They prepare to play

OSRIC
Ay, my good lord.
KING CLAUDIUS
Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
And in the cup an union shall he throw,
Richer than that which four successive kings
In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
HAMLET
Come on, sir.
LAERTES
Come, my lord.
They play

HAMLET
One.
LAERTES
No.
HAMLET
Judgment.
OSRIC
A hit, a very palpable hit.
LAERTES
Well; again.
KING CLAUDIUS
Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
Here's to thy health.
Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within

Give him the cup.
HAMLET
I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.
They play

Another hit; what say you?
LAERTES
A touch, a touch, I do confess.
KING CLAUDIUS
Our son shall win.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
He's fat, and scant of breath.
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;
The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
HAMLET
Good madam!
KING CLAUDIUS
Gertrude, do not drink.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.
KING CLAUDIUS
[Aside] It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.
HAMLET
I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Come, let me wipe thy face.
LAERTES
My lord, I'll hit him now.
KING CLAUDIUS
I do not think't.
LAERTES
[Aside] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
HAMLET
Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
I pray you, pass with your best violence;
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
LAERTES
Say you so? come on.
They play

OSRIC
Nothing, neither way.
LAERTES
Have at you now!
LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES

KING CLAUDIUS
Part them; they are incensed.
HAMLET
Nay, come, again.
QUEEN GERTRUDE falls

OSRIC
Look to the queen there, ho!
HORATIO
They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
OSRIC
How is't, Laertes?
LAERTES
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
HAMLET
How does the queen?
KING CLAUDIUS
She swounds to see them bleed.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.
Dies

HAMLET
O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
Treachery! Seek it out.
LAERTES
It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
No medicine in the world can do thee good;
In thee there is not half an hour of life;
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise
Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,
Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.
HAMLET
The point!--envenom'd too!
Then, venom, to thy work.
Stabs KING CLAUDIUS

All
Treason! treason!
KING CLAUDIUS
O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.
HAMLET
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
Follow my mother.
KING CLAUDIUS dies

LAERTES
He is justly served;
It is a poison temper'd by himself.
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
Nor thine on me.
Dies

HAMLET
Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
That are but mutes or audience to this act,
Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--
But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
To the unsatisfied.
HORATIO
Never believe it:
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
Here's yet some liquor left.
HAMLET
As thou'rt a man,
Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
Absent thee from felicity awhile,
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
To tell my story.
March afar off, and shot within

What warlike noise is this?
OSRIC
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
To the ambassadors of England gives
This warlike volley.
HAMLET
O, I die, Horatio;
The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
I cannot live to hear the news from England;
But I do prophesy the election lights
On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
Which have solicited. The rest is silence.
Dies

HORATIO
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
Why does the drum come hither?
March within

Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors, and others

PRINCE FORTINBRAS
Where is this sight?
HORATIO
What is it ye would see?
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
That thou so many princes at a shot
So bloodily hast struck?
First Ambassador
The sight is dismal;
And our affairs from England come too late:
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
Where should we have our thanks?
HORATIO
Not from his mouth,
Had it the ability of life to thank you:
He never gave commandment for their death.
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
Are here arrived give order that these bodies
High on a stage be placed to the view;
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
How these things came about: so shall you hear
Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I
Truly deliver.
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
Let us haste to hear it,
And call the noblest to the audience.
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
HORATIO
Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
But let this same be presently perform'd,
Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance
On plots and errors, happen.
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
Let four captains
Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
For he was likely, had he been put on,
To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
The soldiers' music and the rites of war
Speak loudly for him.
Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
